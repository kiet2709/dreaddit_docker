"This shadowed figure, he follows me everywhere. I don't know if its a friend or a foe, But he is making my life a mess...He won't leave me alone.","Since birth I have seen this...""**Figure.**"" It was as young as me and the more years I lived, the bigger it became and the more it learned. It was a black and grey figure, bright grey eyes, its arms thin with sharp claws, and missing legs that had purple mist grow from where they should have been. It appeared more frequently every passing day. I told people about it, but nobody wished to believe me. When I told people, they responded with ""*Well, does this 'thing' have a name? If its so real, it must have one.*"" Sadly, I didn't know its name, but one day I built the courage to ask it. I met it in a forest by my house, in private, I asked for its name and why it was always following me. He came close to me and spoke to me. ""*I go by many names,* ***Sadness, Despair, Depression.*** *But in your case, call me...****Autism****.""* Autism said he was connected to me since birth, an accidental life. Back then, I thought he was just a person nobody understood like me, so I let him stay with me. But now, Autism has almost ruined my life. He began forcing me to be different. Separating me from people I cared about and those who cared for me. I didn't believe I could save myself from him. He always held me close, trapped me in strings with hooks that dug into my bones. He used them whenever he wished, and made me a puppet. Whenever he took me over I became ***Aggressive, Harmful, Dangerous.*** I always begged him to leave me alone, but he just laughed and reminded me that we were stuck together. One day, I had had enough. I finally faced the shadow that took me over, and I ***reconciled*** with it. I knew it wouldn't leave, even if I told it to. I asked for it to try and change, to listen to me, to help me become unique, to help me be normal, not a monster, ***to make me a person.*** He stared back at me, and apologized to everything he had done, he had just wanted me to act his way. We spoke until we finally reached an agreement. I had thought my life was turning around. I was making friends, Becoming active, succeeding in school. Although he would return to his habits sometimes, he kept his word and had become a friend of my own. When I introduced people to him some weren't impressed, but most liked him and thought he was interesting. It was working out...until now... I had believed 2020 would be the worst year of my life, because of the events the world is facing. But it ended up being the following year, 2021. My Mother had not been in the greatest of conditions. She was stuck in the hospital due to a mass in her stomach and fluids filling her insides. She was getting better every day, to a point where we could take her back home. (She stayed on a hospital bed at the house though.) I was going to high school one day, when my step dad told me he had the Virus. We lived about 6 streets away from out grandparents, so me and my brother went to live with them until he got better, taking care of my Mother who was still at the house. My Grandparents told me we were going back to check on them, Autism was really nervous about what would happen, but I ignored him. We got there and we said hello to them. Then our stepdad told us the worst news ever, our mom would pass away in the next two days to a week. I was fully aware this was an opportunity to happen, I was already prepared for this, my brother wasn't as much. So today was the day we would say goodbye to her. I won't go into much detail about here, but when we left back to our Grandparents house. I went upstairs and saw Autism sitting on the bed, Sad. I tried to comfort him. Every time I was about to cry, he would tell me ""Crying will not help, its hard to keep the sadness in, but do not shed tears for anybody in front of anybody. It will only make it worse."" These events on my Mom have happened a few days ago, and is about to pass away. I will also state that I am 14 years old and is confessing this here because I need help...I don't know if I should listen to him or not, I really want to let all my emotions out. But I can't...not with him around.....","This shadowed figure, he follows me everywhere. I don't know if its a friend or a foe, But he is making my life a mess...He won't leave me alone.

my boyfriend and i just got approved for our first rental right by my school -- it's a full house!,"I started college in August 2019 and had to take medical leave a few weeks before my first semester ended because I was experiencing severe psychosis and such. it's been such a rough battle since then but I've started taking control of my life like I never had before.

"Why is it that people will call you lazy or weak for not wanting to do anything ever, but then will tell you that suicide isn't the answer?","I never asked to be brought on this world, and yet I'm expected to be a ""normal adult"" and get a job, move out and maintain relationships (things that I've never known how to do).

The way I looked at my depression helped me tremendously.,"I see depression being regarded as a monster, a beast, a fight, and a crushing weight. And I too, for many years, viewed it in those ways. It was hard and at times I felt as I could not ""escape"". One day at my absolute lowest. I decided to change my perspective on it just to see if it would even make a difference. Boy did it. For me, I looked at it like an amusement park and roller coasters. You can sorta guess how this goes, but please allow me to explain Walking through the park, at that level, we feel our baseline ""normal"". The rides represent our mental and emotional highs and lows in life. Everyone walks through the park. For some, that's all they do and they are content. Others get on the gentler rides. They experience both highs and lows but not to extremes, again still content. Then there are the coasters. Many people get on them and then never again. Others, keep riding their favorite one. For me? I was the one rushing between all of them. Running through the park to catch the next. Not staying in my baseline for very long. My depression shared a relationship with those roller coasters. Never staying the same and some bigger or scarier than others. Seeing the highest points between the drop of pure passionate joy. The lows with twists and turns leaving me in fear. And then returning to the station filled with gratitude that it's over safely. But here's were I saw beauty in this...My life is PASSIONATE. Those high points I feel so deeply. Those lows as well. But it's exhilarating through it all. And I know I'll return to the station safe and sound. Bringing friends and family to share in the beautiful moments and hold your hand through the scary. Recognizing my support system that way feels wonderful. And let's not forget therapy or medication (Personally unmedicated but open to it). I look at them like other riders. Especially ones you just can't help but laugh or giggle at when they are over the top or cracking jokes. They help make those fearful moments really not so bad. I just wanted to share this with whomever decides to read this. Just looking at my depression in a different way helped me tremendously in acknowledging and moving forward in where I am and how to handle the difficult times. Does anyone else have any similar methods that helped?","The way I looked at my depression helped me tremendously.

losing control of my life [rant],"This is just me ranting, but any help will be very much appreciated I'm a sophomore in highschool taking all honors and AP classes. My time management has never been the best but I've managed to go through middle school with basically all A's. When sophomore year came along I didn't know how to handle all the work plus trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eventually the semester exams rolled in and that was when it got really bad. I wouldn't sleep or eat for days, always staying in my room trying to cram in order to get my grades up to all A's. Kept this up for a little more than a month and passed the exams, but I was so unimaginably burnt out and had basically no energy left at all. We had winter break for a couple weeks and I hoped that this'll help get my energy back for the next semester. It's been months now and I still don't feel right. The way I got my work done before is obviously not the healthiest but at least I got it done. Now I'm always thinking about the things i need to finish but never actually doing them. Worst part is I don't even procrastinate by doing the things I considered fun, probably would just lie down and watch youtube or look at memes for hours, not really enjoying it but at least I can take my mind off of work for a bit. It makes me a little sad to know that the things I'm learning at school would be things I'd be interested in, but the deadlines and assignments kinda turned potentially fun topics I could be passionate about, into just another load of stuff I need to do. I never go out and hang out with friends anymore, when I do it's because I force myself, so days just consist of me alternating between ""finishing work"" and just mindlessly looking through stuff on reddit. ​ Me and my family are from a third word country, we moved to the US because of my dad's job. My parents were not well off financially at all growing up, they say that if they could endure a life with hardships like that I can deal with a little bit of stress, and because of that I'm always questioning if I'm just whining and milking this to be a bigger deal than it is, or if this is something serious I need to fix. It really feels as if I'm wasting my entire life and that there's no way to pick myself back up again, because if I do take time to rest or figure things out for a couple days it's as if I'm be taking time away from schoolwork. If you read this far thanks for hearing me out, have a nice day )","losing control of my life [rant] This is just me ranting, but any help will be very much appreciated I'm a sophomore in highschool taking all honors and AP classes.

"I don't want to die but if I was offered a chance to erase myself from existence, I would take it","Apologies in advance for the ramble that follows and for any mistakes as this isn't my native language. No matter how busy I make myself, it all seems pointless in the end. What the fuck am I working towards ? Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down. Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day.

Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down. Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day. Honestly feel like instead of growing as a person, I deteriorated in the last few years. I have no motivation left except that I love my parents and them having to witness my death will destroy them. If only there was a way to erase myself from everyone's memories.",1
Worst night yet (long rant),"I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it. For the next 3 weeks, I've got a big important test each day. They're not even exams, just big tests. I told myself that I would start studying yesterday i came home, opened my agenda and started crying, it was big, ungly, loud sobs. I'm so stressed, I basically had a mental breakdown over school, and this isnt even the hardest year. One of the only ways I deal w stress is cutting myself, so that occupied me for a while. People always say put ur mental health before school work, but for me, a lazy perfectionist, that makes my mental health worse. I'm so tired because by the time I've finished crying about how much work I have, I'm completely drained and I fall asleep. I then wake up when my parents come home so 8PM, have dinner and then start my school work. I'm usually still up at 1-2 AM. Then I wake up at 7 and start again. AND MY TEACHERS THEN GIVE US MORE FUCKING WORK CUZ U KNOW, 1 MENTAL BREAKDOWN A WEEK ISNT ENOUGH!!!! I cant fucking deal w this anymore but if I give up on school then I'll be even more stressed if such a thing is possible","Worst night yet (long rant) I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it.

People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,"UPDATE So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former. Original post Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves. Edit It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. Edit 2 Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means. Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there. Edit 3 If you're in the US, UK, Canada or Aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc ","People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.

Stressed about new job,"Hey guys, I recently got a new job at an IT firm. But before confirming my role in the company, I have to take an assessment. I am currently attending a training course for that. Some of the topics are completely new and they are taken in such a short amount of time. I have so many assignments to finish. I have been sleeping less than 5 hours everyday for the past one and a half months. I think I have reached a breaking point. I feel like throwing up all the time. I am constantly on the brink of tears and feel so helpless. With all of this going on, I cannot even prepare properly for the assessment.

Where I'm sure in my decisions with with a handful of my most recent stress inducing situations, and how I handled them.. the discordance in others is stifling and I'm not sure how to handle things. The upset causes my emotions to muddy my decisions, and vice versa- and stress seems to be a catalyst in all of it. It's taken its toll on me over time, and I'm worried about damage it's caused, or is causing.

Mental check in with a stranger. Weird?,"Hi This is my very first post on Reddit. I’m 35, transplanted to San Francisco to work in tech two years, and I miss my family very much since they all live really far away from the States. I know it was my choice, and I should no complain about it. However, living in a new country, learning a new language, and adapting myself to a new culture have been challenging. I realized my mood has been constantly shifting more often than before. I could be totally okay but irrationally emotional when I experience something that remind me certain past feelings. I realized I need help. But how? I am alone here without genuine friends close by. I don’t think talking to my old friends or colleagues could help cus it puts me in a vulnerable position where I’d feel uncomfortable. I don’t think I need to seek for a pro therapy yet but I definitely need to feel cared, heard and supported. I started to wonder if there’re million of people like me who feel lonely and helpless lightly from time to time. Recently, I got connected with a person over the internet. We didn’t know much about each other but we just started this short check-in everyday somehow. I felt there is a hope and need to keep going cus I want to report my daily life briefly to this person. Sometime my day is bad and sometime isn’t. I don’t feel shame if I say I procrastinate today to this person. I actually feel a relief by saying that to a real person even I have no intention to meet with this person in person. Am I weird? Would you desire to have this kind of check-in experience with someone that both of you have no clues of who they are?","Mental check in with a stranger. Weird?

Don’t know what’s wrong with me,"Ok I’m sorry to have to just rant but I’m dealing with so much right now, I’ve been with my gf for 5+ years, we’ve had our ups and downs and my depression has slightly gotten worse the past few years making me job hop because I panic and give up, I left my recent job due to just not feeling good and just dreading it because it was taking time away from my gf and the dogs.

"Being in a relationship is a rollercoaster, but in the end it's so worth it","As with anything in life there are both peaks and lows (just ask Bitcoin xD). But I'd like to hop on here to talk about the most important person in my life ^D. My Girlfriend and I , it's so weird calling her my girlfriend because she is basically my best friend ^D, has changed my life so much and seeing her grow everyday constantly inspires me to do the same. She's made me realize that I have a side of me that doesn't have to be this super macho tough dude , it's okay to have a down moment , it's okay to talk about things , it's okay to not be okay blue_heart white_heart . Finding that special someone who can be that ear that always listens has brought me so much happiness. I'm not saying its always dandelions (maybe not dandelions, she's big boi allergic to them xD) and roses for our relationship all the time , but talking about the quarrels we experience ultimately strengthen the bond between us , even if said quarrels are super hard to talk about . Bottling it up inside isn't the way to go , trust me I learned that the hard way; always strive for happiness. If I had one word to describe my best friend, it would be happiness . She's done more for me in close to a year than most of my long time friends have , it's just a testament of her outstanding character ^D. I want to keep doing everything in my power to keep my best friend happy . Her smile , her eyes , her nose , the way she smells , her amazing sense of humor , ability to understand someone else's perspective, artistic aptitude, and her intelligence are all just a few reasons why she is the perfect one for me <3. I tell her how amazing she is all the time , but I felt like I wanted to get it out in the void that is reddit.

Apologies for the grammar mistakes and idiom overload , it's kinda my thing xD PS PS. I don't have anything else, I just thought it would be cool to have another PS hehe TL;DR She's definitely the ""one""","Being in a relationship is a rollercoaster, but in the end it's so worth it As with anything in life there are both peaks and lows (just ask Bitcoin xD).

URGENT} 24/7 Head Pressure and Awful Brain Fog,"Symptoms - 24/7 head pressure in the top back of my head and over my ears to the back. Awful brain fog where I can barely drive or go in stores or do much of anything. I feel like I’m in a dream like state to an extent where everything is in a fog and it’s like I’m not really present (I believe this is called dissociation). I also have blurry vision and just overall feel very off. I can’t remember the last time I felt truly energized and overall just well. This is going to be a long post but I GREATLY appreciate whoever contributes. In October of last year I got extremely stressed. I moved to California and got an apartment 2 weeks before covid hit in March and immediately everything was shut down, buildings were boarded up. I was okay most of the year until I lost my job, and started freaking out about how I’m going to pay rent etc. Also my wisdom teeth started causing problems and I needed to get them removed. Once I found out the price for this (I didn’t have insurance yet) it caused severe stress. It seemed like everything from lack of job, lack of money, lack of social life, lack of interaction was just taking over with physical symptoms of stress and anxiety. I have had nights where I wake up gasping for air as if I’m not breathing, I have had many days where I can’t even walk or do activity because I feel so faint. I have spoke to 2 psychiatrists about this and explained how my symptoms have been 24/7 for now 7 months and they both said they haven’t heard of stress and anxiety being a constant for that long without a break. I have tried lexapro for a month and a half at 10 mg (which I know is a low dose) and it had no effect. I have went to every specialist from ent, neurologist, emergency room twice, eye doctor, neuro ophthalmologist, allergist and gotten every scan imaginable from mri to mra to mrv to ct to angiogram and everything is always normal. These symptoms have pretty much debilitated me from living my life in any way which has then let to depression from having no life. It’s got to the point where just going to a new doctor appointment would make me feel extremely anxious and faint because I feel like it’s just an ongoing series where I go to the doctor and they don’t help and I repeat for months. Everything is just centered around the stress and anxiety of what could be causing this and doctors having no idea. Every single day I search my symptoms and constantly am online looking into this, it’s pretty much all I do. What’s throwing me off is the 2 psychiatrist saying these symptoms can’t be constant because I have seen other posts online saying otherwise. The last psychiatrist said I can try Zoloft. I would appreciate if anyone can comment having dealt with similar symptoms and letting me know if Zoloft or any ssri helped. I know getting off the computer and outside more can be very helpful .

Difficulty in breathing,"It's been many years since I've stressed about a lot of things which were out of my control and that damaged me in different ways like losing strength, muscle fragility etc. But last year I faced something which has slowed me a lot, as soon as I see myself getting close to a stressful situation let it be a argument with someone, I feel that something tight is being heavily pressed against my upper abs (where chest ends and stomach starts) and I'm unable to breathe. As a result I have to be in bed for hours till I get back to normal. This issue has started causing a lot of problem for me as I have to do lots of stuff but I'm unable to. Can anyone suggest any way by which this issue can be resolved or can happen less often?","Difficulty in breathing It's been many years since I've stressed about a lot of things which were out of my control and that damaged me in different ways like losing strength, muscle fragility etc. But last year I faced something which has slowed me a lot, as soon as I see myself getting close to a stressful situation let it be a argument with someone, I feel that something tight is being heavily pressed against my upper abs (where chest ends and stomach starts) and I'm unable to breathe.

How do you get over overthinking???,"Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always overthought. If I make a mistake, I’ll think about it for days, which turn into weeks, and sometimes months. For example, about a week and a half ago I picked up my friend and her cousin and went to the mall and I accidentally took the exit incorrectly (there was traffic cones and shit), and I still think about because I’m so embarrassed. The moment keeps replaying in my head and I keep coming up with solutions to the situation. Like, what if I killed us 3? What if I hurt other people exiting? What if everyone’s scared of driving with me again? What if I hit someone, or someone hit me? What if there wasn’t any road right there? What could’ve happened because of my stupidity? Like Im just so fucking annoying and stupid and dumb. I hate me bro. I’ll think about things that happened years ago and it’ll be on my mind for the longest time until I just simply forget. Sometimes when I get the thinking and get annoyed in a way, and I slap my head. As if I can slap the thought out of me. It stresses me out so bad. Sometimes I just wish I could just die so I won’t have to think at all. My thoughts eat away at me. My friend kept yelling at me last night, and the more she did, the more sadder I got and kept overthinking that I was an annoying pest and they didn’t want me around. I kept calling people to say Happy Halloween and both my friends kept yelling. And I know they meant it innocently, but now I just can’t/won’t stop thinking about it. I just know it. I just don’t know how to stop thinking. And I need help. How do I stop overthinking? What can I do?","How do you get over overthinking??? Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always overthought.

Mom only takes my depression seriously when I mention suicide.,"99% of the time when I don’t mention suicide? It’s just a phase and I need a “reality check”. Thanks mom. Edit I see some of the comments thinking I’m a teenager going through a “phase” and I’d like to clarify that I’m 24 and I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety. I have a therapist, am on antidepressants and my mom is a narcissist. Even with the help I have, it gets hard at times and I vent. Thank you for the well wishes, everyone. I hope we can get through this together.","Mom only takes my depression seriously when I mention suicide. 99% of the time when I don’t mention suicide? It’s just a phase and I need a “reality check”.

homeless in 3 months,"so background info we were planning on selling our house before buying a new one. our current house has 2 rooms and i (19F) share a room with my sister (16F). the real estate market in our country is INSANE, most houses are apartments and a small 3-room apartment costs upwards of $450k for a 99-year lease. mom's friend coincidentally was looking for a house in our area, and she offered to buy our house for 365k, inclusive of a 3 month extension period before we have to move out. everything goes smoothly, until she chooses to back out the last minute before the legal agreement of ""reserving"" our flat expires - effectively wasting 27 days of our time. By now, we already have an apartment we wanted to buy - settled on the price (488k) which was a steal in a city-fringe location. so now we have a buyer who's still interested in buying our house - and they offered $360k without the extension, because their own extension on their current house is expiring soon too. parents accept the offer, and tell me and my sister. rendering us homeless in 3 months because the new house has to undergo renovation for a few months starting october(most likely complete in jan 2022). continuing in comments because my phone is lagging out due to the word count.","homeless in 3 months so background info we were planning on selling our house before buying a new one. our current house has 2 rooms and i (19F) share a room with my sister (16F). the real estate market in our country is INSANE, most houses are apartments and a small 3-room apartment costs upwards of $450k for a 99-year lease. mom's friend coincidentally was looking for a house in our area, and she offered to buy our house for 365k, inclusive of a 3 month extension period before we have to move out. everything goes smoothly, until she chooses to back out the last minute before the legal agreement of ""reserving"" our flat expires - effectively wasting 27 days of our time.

Help me calm my worries PLEASE (college and career related),"Hello, I am a junior in high school who has a good gpa but average sat scores. I also play volleyball and am pretty good at it.

I feel so much pressure to go to a decent school and get a scholarship for volleyball. Obviously I'm very capable of doing this but my mind always seems to stop me from feeling capable. I feel lost as well because I should know what I want to major in by now. All i know is that I would like to help people, but that doesn't really get me anywhere.

I’m worried I’m going to disappoint my family,"I don’t really know where to turn and I’m running out of options. I’m in Med school, abroad, and am embroiled in trying to earn a few more points on a major exam so that I can attend my sister’s wedding, which is to be held in the States. The exam I failed has a make up, but it is literally scheduled the day after the wedding, so to travel back abroad still means I would have to miss out on the occasion, which itself can’t be delayed any further. I know that I am not the strongest of students, but I really felt confident with the particular exam, and now because of my own damn fault I may be withheld from going. I just feel like I’m letting everyone down, like I’m just destined to keep failing. It’s hard to talk to people close to me on this matter, despite me doing so, because it just goes back into this loop of “you did this to yourself, you need to dedicate more time to studying, etc.” I don’t disagree with the feedback, but it’s not helping me right now. I just feel trapped. Update well, I tried. I went to the University office, and it was such a farce. They stopped any conversation saying “Their hands are tied,” or “we are legally bound from doing ...”, including providing the answer key to said exam so that I could see where the points were lost. I won’t be attending my sister’s wedding, and will have to sit in for the make up exam. I never minded sitting for the exam, it’s just the timing of it all. I could go on about how pathetic the scheduling system is, how I can’t even access the exam admit card until a few days prior to the exam, but it’s not going to do me any good. Wish me luck on this exam please. You’ve all been very kind. As for my family, of course they are understanding of the situation.

And when I buy the thing I always feel guilty afterwards ( Does this happen to anyone else? Any tips on how to not feel guilty?,1
Repressed Emotions,"You can't feel anything no matter what you're facing. You are always stuck in a certain type of emotion ( rage , hate , fear ... ) You experience several body illnesses and the doctors tell you nothing is wrong with you.

What do you do next?,"So I've sorted made it through the second major depressive episode, slight psychosis like symptoms and hospital stay... I just don't know what's next? I feel ok now, not really even depressed... I've got a plethora of medication a booking with some private psychiatrist and a psychologist that'll be a fairly significant ongoing cost - what are these people really going to be able to do for me? I have a few more weeks off work still and have had about 8 weeks off now. I don't feel super secure with my job there anymore... Second time off for mental health issue in 3 years, I expect I'll be top on the list to remove come next redundancy or performance review etc. I'm reading, learning and doing what I know to help try stimulate BDNF and neurogenesis.. I don't want early onset dementia - if I can help it at all. I've applied at a lot of jobs, haven't heard much back yet but it's still early. I figure finding work and continuing to do the normal things is the right thing to do? It just seems weird that I've gone through this near delusional psychosis event, in a hospital under watch and keep and now I'm spat out at home and I guess left to it. I just don't know what to do. I don't even know if I am really recovered yet? What does recovery even look like now.","What do you do next?

I have nothing to keep going for now since even my mom is depressed,"I've given up on myself years ago (24F), but recently my mom has told me that she wants to give up too. Now I'm truly over whatever life is at this point. I don't have a single hobby, the things I find interesting I'm not good at, my job keeps me afloat since everyone is open their feelings/mental, but it all feels so colorless. I have friends but not sure if they think of me the way I think of them (probably overreacting,) I want to move but don't want to put myself into my friend's friends groups, and overall I'm just lost. Been there so many therapist but unfortunately in the south I get hit with lots of ""pray about it.""

Being in nature reduces stress and blood pressure - but crucially also stops us ruminating on the past and future,"Spending time in nature makes a huge difference to our mental health; research has shown it can decrease our stress levels, reduce our heart rate and reduce our blood pressure - but one of the most interesting effects it has is to reduce how much we ruminate, how much we attach ourselves to our thoughts. When we get swept away by our thoughts and lose touch with the present moment, suffering isn’t far behind. Being lost in the past and future drives a great deal of our sadness and anxiety. Where nature is incredibly powerful is in its ability to focus our attention, taking us out of our heads and into our surroundings via our senses. And aside from all that, it takes us away from the information bombardment for a little while, away from our work and our phone and the TV. So when we give our full attention to a bird that's landed on a tree or take the time to look at the different parts of a flower we’re giving a minds a break and bringing ourselves back to the only place we can be happy - here and now.

Life Sucks,"Have you ever just sat and cried all because the one you loved lied. Have you ever wondered why should I try when all that boy does is make me cry.

They slipped me an extra sandwich in the drive through,"There was a certain sandwich that I hadn’t noticed on the menu before. It was a sort of BLT and I heckin’ love BLTs.

I told my husband, “shoot. I was really excited to try that.” When we got home, we did an audit of our order and made sure we have everything. An extra sandwich? My husband looks at me and says, “oh my gosh, did they just give you one anyway?” They did. The fast food employee gave me an extra sandwich that I wanted to try, just to be nice. It tasted amazing and I will absolutely go out of my way to order it next time. tldr wanted a sandwich at drive thru. Couldn’t get sandwich.

My boyfriend and I are on homecoming court!!,"This afternoon my boyfriend (17M) and I (17F) found out we would be on our schools homecoming court, and it felt so surreal! I had to keep looking at the announcement post over and over to make sure I wasn’t dreaming! For some context, we’re both seniors and were one of four couples most voted out of around 12+ couples! It makes me really happy, because I’m a shy, mostly introverted kid, and I have a lot of social anxiety, and it’s just really good to have a sort of…validation from my peers, you know? Although I also owe a lot of it to my boyfriend, he’s really outgoing and charming, I don’t think I could’ve ever gained the confidence to do this without him! I’m super excited for the homecoming game now, I’m determined to make my senior year the best yet! It’s funny too, we were supposed to find out who was on the court last Friday, but due to technical issues (they left one of the couples off the ballot) and ties (apparently four couples tied for second place! Isn’t that crazy?!) we had to revote today! I was anxious my entire class after voting, but it felt so good to see our names there! If you don’t mind me getting mushy, I really appreciate my boyfriend a lot and am so excited to get to do this with him. We both had really bad previous relationships, and it was something we bonded over. He treats me so well, he likes to show me off, is always loving to me, and I can tell him anything! I can’t express just how much I appreciate him, because I really do. He even bought me a froggy bucket hat that he gave me earlier today! Honestly, my day has just been really amazing, and I hope yours is too!","My boyfriend and I are on homecoming court!!

Should I tell my father about my chronic stomach pain due to stress?,"About 2 years ago, I started having terrible stomach pains all the time, which were usually worsened by any kind of stress that I faced throughout the day. Last year, my father became very worried about this, and decided to take me to the doctor to see what could be causing it. My bowel movements were regular, I avoided foods that I was allergic to, and the doctor could not find anything wrong. But I did not mention my stress to her at the time. After this visit, I took a blood test and an ultrasound, but I seemed to be in perfect health. Then, we saw a GI doctor, and I finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the cause of my stomach pain. After I explained the situation a little more, he told me that my issues were definitely stress related, and that I should visit a psychiatrist. He also advised me to start taking therapy. I actually used to take therapy for something other than stress. I had been regularly engaging in self harm, and fallen into the deep pits of depression about a year before my stomach pains had started. So when my father found out, he asked me to start taking therapy. It worked great, and I loved going, but I think we all know that therapy is pretty expensive. My father has a good, stable job, and is paid well enough, but my mother doesn't have a job and he has two children. We try not to spend too much money, but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible. So I stopped taking therapy after we moved cities. My father started getting paid around $20,000 more per year after the move, and we started living in an area where rent is much more reasonable. A few months ago, my father told me that he wanted me to start taking therapy again if my stomach pain would not go away. But I knew that he would still have a difficult time affording it. I also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that I was causing him. I love my father a lot, and I don't want to trouble him any more than I already do. So I started lying to him and saying that my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. I thought I would be able to keep up the lie, but the pain seems to only be getting worse.

How can you tell if you’re lazy or just depressed?,"I’ve had depression since I was 15 (I’m 29) so it kinda just feels like part of my personality at this point.

I just want to be passionate about something again,"It's been so fucking long. I try to find a hobby, a goal, a fucking anything, but I just can't.

My neighbour is stressing me out,"She has two kids, and her friends always come over with small children and baby's. We love in an apartment, she's the door right across from me. When we first moved in two years ago we introduced ourselves to her and her partner at the time we were very friendly.

Though out the years we have tried knocking on her door asking her to move her car for snow removal, and to maybe split with us to get the whole driveway plowed but she never answers her door even if we know she's in there. So we noticed that our garbage bin was full of loose garbage for a while, not ours, we cleaned it out put it in bags and took it to the curb....the next week it was full again (dog poop, baby dipers) (the neighbour just got a dog last summer) we empty it again wanting to use our garbage bin......the next week it's full again so we leave it. (It's been full for 3 months now and no one has touched it) so a week later we go to put our compost into our compost bin, and it's full of garbage, the same kinda loose stuff in the bin. We have no idea what to do with our compost now last week we took it and put it in our downstairs neighbors compost bin at the curb...... ( Now I don't know if it's actually her garbage, bug I've always seen her garbage in the ally and never at the curb including when she had bags) to me I know it's her but I don't know what to do about it. If I try to get ahold of her she ignores the door, and if I leave a note on her door she will probably just chuck it and be made at us cause she's untitled. (She smokes in her apartment and blasts music and always seems to be partying) I have no idea what I should do....

I feel like I have a relatively good life at face value, but sometimes I just feel so upset and my hobbies don’t make me happy anymore. I feel terrible that I’m not grateful at how lucky I am for the life that 3rd worlders kill for. I feel like there is a heavy anchor of sadness constantly in my chest. I want to cry but find it impossible when I try. I don’t know how to get through this or make it easier, but writing this makes me feel a little better but I feel like it won’t be reliable. What do you guys do for this? I know it might not work for me but I’m sick of this shit and want it to go away. I want to be happy again.

You all know exactly what I’m talking about. I feel like I have a relatively good life at face value, but sometimes I just feel so upset and my hobbies don’t make me happy anymore. I feel terrible that I’m not grateful at how lucky I am for the life that 3rd worlders kill for. I feel like there is a heavy anchor of sadness constantly in my chest. I want to cry but find it impossible when I try. I don’t know how to get through this or make it easier, but writing this makes me feel a little better but I feel like it won’t be reliable. What do you guys do for this? I know it might not work for me but I’m sick of this shit and want it to go away. I want to be happy again.

"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""... Just no.","I hate this, I hear it here and there and my blood starts boiling every time. No, everything in life that happens isnt somehow okay because ""oh you've learned from it."" I'm not stronger because of my trauma, I am strong inspite of it.

I almost killed myself tonight,"I know nobody will read this... I was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. Stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. But I never drank it. Something stopped me and I'm not sure what. But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty. The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy.

My sister is depressed and idk how to help her,"My sister, over the last few weeks, hasn't left the house and hasn't left the room except for food.

I'm too fucked up. I just exist. I doubt anyone will care to read this... they never do.,"I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am. I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me. My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income. I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off. All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them. I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways. **EDIT I'm seeing a therapist online.** **EDIT 2 I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments...

"As of an hour ago, me and my wife are on our final step to fully adopting our kid. All that's left now is a court hearing. We're so excited!!!","I'll try and keep this short and sweet. It's been six months since we took in our girl and almost from the outset, we had every intention of fully adopting her. Sure me and her had our differences, mainly because of me and bottling up my emotions over a tragedy we suffered years prior, but I've started seeing her as my daughter now and we're closer than ever. During this time, we've had visits from our agency that come and conduct wellness checks on both the living conditions of the house and also to see how we're doing, especially her. And every time it's gone smoothly and perfectly, at least for their requirements. So we had another visit from them today and this was what we anticipated most. It was just more paperwork to be submitted to the court as well as an official Petition to Adoption that we needed to finally complete. While me and my wife were doing this though, one of the other agents sat with our daughter privately to just talk and ask how things were going, if she genuinely wanted to stay with us, anything bad that was happening that we weren't telling them, etc. And at the end, they brought her back in and said that now, all that's left is for them to submit everything to the court for a judge to review. They said that hopefully we should expect a response within 30 days but oftentimes it's sooner depending on how clean the background check is and a few other things. ""We're almost there"" she (our agent) said. It's funny because our daughter, while she was extremely happy with how everything was going, wasn't nearly as filled with joy as me and my wife were. My wife was actually crying and couldn't contain herself. She nearly smothered her in her arms giving her a bear hug. I hugged her too and just looked her dead in the eyes and said ""We're almost there baby girl"" before kissing her forehead. I mean I just don't know what to say or how to say it at this point. This is like a dream come true with everything we've lost but also have gained so much more in the process. It breaks my heart thinking about how many other kids her age or around it (she's 14) are out there but will never have a permanent home like she will. But, I try not to think about it and am just thankful we have a kid as perfect as her in our lives.","As of an hour ago, me and my wife are on our final step to fully adopting our kid.

""We're almost there"" she (our agent) said. It's funny because our daughter, while she was extremely happy with how everything was going, wasn't nearly as filled with joy as me and my wife were. My wife was actually crying and couldn't contain herself. She nearly smothered her in her arms giving her a bear hug. I hugged her too and just looked her dead in the eyes and said ""We're almost there baby girl"" before kissing her forehead. I mean I just don't know what to say or how to say it at this point. This is like a dream come true with everything we've lost but also have gained so much more in the process. It breaks my heart thinking about how many other kids her age or around it (she's 14) are out there but will never have a permanent home like she will. But, I try not to think about it and am just thankful we have a kid as perfect as her in our lives.",0
Why am I still stressed out about schoolwork even though school is out for the summer?,"I just went through a prolonged period of stress due to AP exams, interviewing for/working a new job, final projects, SATs, getting behind in schoolwork, getting worse end-of-year grades than usual, and grieving over my pet hedgehog dying (I really loved him and it was really awful when he died). I am not a ""crier"" in any way usually. Up until about a week ago, I couldn't remember the last time I cried. Now, even though that period of stress has passed and it's now summer break, I feel like I could cry at any moment if I wanted to. I can understand that, of course, because I'm still recovering from all that emotional overload, but what I can't understand is why I still feel stressed about SCHOOLWORK specifically. Every time I try and think about planning what I'm going to do this summer, I start to get the same anxiety I feel with schoolwork deadlines, studying for tests, or anything else school related. Even though I try to tell myself that I have no schoolwork left, my brain somehow just doesn't believe me?? I feel like I can't do anything fun this summer because I'm so busy with schoolwork even though I literally have no schoolwork to do at all. Why is this happening and how do I move on so that I can actually enjoy my summer break? It's making me even more anxious and sad thinking about how excited I normally am for summer and how I'm just wasting my summer away feeling absolutely miserable. It's 4 45 am right now and I'm sitting awake in bed writing this because I can't sleep. Help!","Why am I still stressed out about schoolwork even though school is out for the summer?

Is addiction causing you stress?,"Many of us struggle with various types of addictions - internet, cigarettes, alcohol, gambling etc. Addiction puts lots of pressure on our own self and our loved ones. How many of us have thought about the origin of our addictions and the reasons why it's so hard to get rid of these habits? One of the biggest question remains is whether we are substituting our empty lives with these habits that are no longer serving our higher goals. There are several research studies that directs us to the fact that past Trauma could be the reason for addiction. As a Coach, I have worked closely with people with addiction issues and so far my realization is that many of them had gone through some form of abuse & trauma in the past. Abuse can come in different forms physical, mental, sexual, psychological and emotional. It is quite important to identify our past trauma and get some help rather than sweeping our problems under the carpet and living in denial. As humans we all need self care and community support to stay healthy and happy. Practicing spiritual activities (meditation, mindfulness etc) will help us to heal our past trauma and wounds.","Is addiction causing you stress?

I need to find a way to calm down,"I´m unsure about what is going to happen to me. I have two jobs, one part-time, and one full time. The problem is, I might have been kicked out of my part-time job (it´s a job from home), because an email that was supposed to arrive three days earlier arrived only this morning. For my full time job, I might have to leave it after this summer ends. I´m starting my university, and my contract might not be switched to a part-time one, because the company is slowly losing it´s money, and my boss might not be willing to keep me in there. And now I´m unsure about my future. My mom is moving out at the end of the year, so I have to find a way to work while I´m going to study at an university, and a way to pay my bills, and a new place to live at. On top of that, I haven´t been with my girlfriend in three months due to my tight work schedule. And I also need money to save up money for a ton of stuff for the university. If I´m getting kicked out of my full time work at the end of the next month, then I have only about 900€ to survive with until the end of year. My family is unwilling to help me, because nobody has a place for me to stay at, or the will to help me financially. My heart is racing, I feel heavy. I don´t know what the fuck should I do to easy this stress. I´ve tried watching Shia LaBeouf screaming in front of a greenscreen, I´ve tried watching Bob Ross, I´ve tried ASMR, I´ve tried smoking, but nothing helps. I don´t want to go back to alcohol, because let´s be honest, I can´t afford it. What should I do? How do I calm down? EDIT 1 So, I wasn´t kicked out of the job, my account just got somehow blocked on the page during the process of my supervisors reviewing my work. This morning, my boss responded to my email, and told me that I have two options; I could quit the job or I could stay, but I´d have to be re-trained (I review newspapers as my part time job) and I´d have to work even more, because reviewing 300 pages of newspapers wasn´t enough (he told me that I need to review at least 2000 pages a month). He was very understanding and wasn´t menacing or awful about it. He said that he understands that I might have a time restrain or that I might not feel like doing the job. I agreed to his offer to pay me this month´s work, and I´m now waiting for his response. So yes, I´ve had to quit the part time job. A big stone fell of my heart, as I now have my time for my hobbies back (making music, recording videos, gaming, reading). Also, for my full time job, it was confirmed that I wouldn´t be kicked out. And, because I am at the end of my two months testing period, I´m allowed to take vacation, so now I will have time to go get signed up for my university, and to finally, after two months, go to a lot of doctors (I have a lot of skin problems, my eyesight and colorblindness are getting worse, and maybe even seeking out psychiatric help for my stress, anxiety and depression issues). Turns out, all I needed to do was just to vent to my girlfriend. She was very understanding about my situation, and is very supportive.

Should I tell my boss?,"I work on a team of 4, and we are extremely behind. Our workload has tripled in the last year without adding additional headcount. My coworker spends most of her day socializing and I am struggling to get my much heavier work load done. She pretends she’s too busy to finish her work so others will help her and stays late so it appears she’s working hard. My boss is in a different area so he doesn’t see it. The stress of the workload is causing problems with my health. My question is, is it reasonable to tell my boss what’s going on or does that make me seem like a troublemaker?","Should I tell my boss?

Does depression make you want to break-up?,"My (29f) bf (29m) has been going on and off about breaking up with me since the last year. We have been in a eight year long relationship. He was seeking help for depression 3-4 years ago but he never completed treatment, because he started feeling better soon. One year ago, we hit a rough patch, with him doubting things in our relationship and that i did not love him / cheated on him because i was not fully honest with him regarding some things (which I've apologised for, but i never cheated on him) . He quit his job at the same time and started freelancing for a while, only to resume work two months ago in July 2021. Before starting this job, he did seek professional help (not on my insistence, but because he said he needed help with sleep) He was on lexapro and another medicine for 2-3 months before he ghosted his psychiatrist, saying that the doctor was just ripping him off. He has faced major setbacks in his friendships over the last one year, he doubts most of his friends and doubts their intentions, does not feel happy in general. The reason why i think he is depressed is, I cannot recall a time when he was genuinely happy about anything (maybe apart from when he got this new job, but it soon turned into a stressful situation, since this is not full-time employment yet and his performance will be evaluated after he completes 3 months). Earlier, when he would break up with me, he would come back every other week, saying he does love me and cannot live without me and used to apologise for his behaviour. Since the past few months, his stance has become, ""I never loved you, I was wrong to be with you for eight years, I am sorry I didn't say this earlier, even if I did love you, I don't now. You must move on, I will too"". We still meet each other on the weekends, at times, i am helping him out with his grad-school applications (building resume, SOPs, LORs, essays) and we still do talk on a regular basis, it's just that he will be awfully moody one day and then get started with his ""You should move on, I dont love you"" talk. I am trying to understand which part is true, his depression, or his words. I have told him for now, that we are broken up but the conversation on moving on, is something we can have when he is feeling like himself. Our friends also point out his approach of painting everything in black if anything remotely grey is associated with a thing, and they do call him out, at times. But his recent more fierce stance on saying how he does not love me and never did, makes me wonder if i am the one just living in my own thoughts and things weren't what i think they were. We have spent 8 years together and had every intention of building a future together (which even he has talked about, at times, on multiple occasions in the last one year) I am ready to hold on if it's just his depression talking, I have loved him enough to know I can continue for some more time. But I am just not sure if I am right, anymore.","Does depression make you want to break-up? My (29f) bf (29m) has been going on and off about breaking up with me since the last year.

I get specific symptoms while doing specific tasks and need help determining how to move forward...,"Since starting my first real job August 2020, I've been experiencing some symptoms while working Chest pressure. Sometimes (although rarely) causing hypertension or difficulty breathing. Inability to concentrate. The symptoms may persist for some time after stopping the day's work, although rarely for long. They get worse throughout the week, and seem to be the mildest on Mondays. They are also mildest in the morning, worsening throughout the day. The symptoms are worsened while performing difficult tasks, or tasks that have no clear way towards a solution. While doing tasks that I know how to solve, the symptoms are lessened, and sometimes disappear completely. I work as a software developer. I am 24 and male. While the symptoms are present, I can hardly get any work done. I cannot concentrate or think clearly. After a workday I am completely drained, and have little mental capacity to do anything but watch Netflix. It has gotten to a point where I am drawn towards avoiding work to not experience the symptoms, hence me seeking help here. Obviously, I'm writing this post here, because I suspect this may be related to stress. I don't have any obvious stressors in my life, and generally do not ""feel stressed"". My main inquiry is how I should move forward? I've scheduled a doctor's appointment, but how do I ""treat"" this? Do I seek out psychological therapy? Should I consider another career path? Might this be a physical condition? I'd really love some input!","I get specific symptoms while doing specific tasks and need help determining how to move forward...

I miss the person I used to be,"I'll admit that even years ago I wasn't very happy and had problems, but I still miss the way I was back then. I still had things that made me happy, hobbies I enjoyed. And I actually had the motivation to do them! I could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while. Now I can't find the motivation to do anything. But I think most of all I miss how hopeful I was. Despite everything I fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. And I've lost that completely. I don't have any hope anymore, I don't have any motivation, I don't have anything to look forward to. And I just really fucking miss that part of me","I miss the person I used to be I'll admit that even years ago I wasn't very happy and had problems, but I still miss the way I was back then.

I just want to quit everything,"It's a long story, but I'll tell as shortly as possible. I'm gay so I worked very hard for my entire life to move to Europe to study and live there. After I finished my bachelor very successfully, I got very ill. Nothing too serious, but 4 separate illnesses piled up at the same time, and this ruined me. I had started a master's, but I had to quit and move back in with my family in my country. My country has mandatory military service. Being in the shape that I was and also being gay, I was in no shape for military service. So I started a master's in another field that I thought was easy, the military service is postponed if you're studying. I took care of my illnesses in the meantime, except for my serious allergy problem whose treatment lasts approx 5 years, I'm still ongoing through that treatment. I've arrived at the thesis state of my master's, but gosh, I just hate it so much. I don't want to do it anymore. It's so stressful, and also so pointless, that I just want to quit everything. I simply don't want to do it and no force can make me want to. Because I'm a very straightforward and authentic person. If I don't want to truly do something, I just can't do it. But if I quit, I would have to go to military service, and I'm still going through treatment. I could try getting an exemption by saying I'm gay, there's such a system in place, but I'm not sure if they would believe me, and I'm not sure what it indicates for my future. I can't get a postponement because of my treatment, they don't listen to that even though the actual reality is that I'm having breathing problems all day long. That's the life I have to go through. The only thing I could possibly do is to sign up to say that I'm gay. And funny thing is, I have a 3.98 GPA, so externally it doesn't make sense to quit, but yet still, I hate the program so much. It makes every awaken moment of life feel like disaster. I hate this. I don't want to be in this situation and I don't want to live like this. But yet I'm tied up and can't move on. I can barely lift my head up anymore and I don't know what to do. I guess I literally don't want to do anything. I just want to quit everything that's all. Also, I'm extremely lonely. I don't have any friends that want to see me and no one proper wants to date me either. I was doing really fine in life and I knew the value of it too, never took it for granted. I was happy. And I wanted to make other people happy too. But my life got ruined. I can't solve any of this anymore and I feel like I'm out of my mind. I just don't want to do anything anymore. I just want to quit. Thanks for listening. Any advice is appreciated.","I just want to quit everything It's a long story, but I'll tell as shortly as possible.

Also I know facebook and social media are just awful for mental health but I sadly can't delete it as I need to for my business and sadly as much as I try and just use it only for that I get sucked in from time to time. While I'm editing I just want to say thank you for the supportive messages and everything you have made me feel a lot better though I'm sorry to have vented at you all I kind of figured this post would mostly be ignored as well and I'm sure there are far more needing people you could offer support to.

"I know someone ain't gonna read this, but anyways. Here's some nonsense wrote by a 19 years old child.","I don't want to think about my future. It's dark. Why ? Because I'm not sure about my future plans. What if they doesn't work ? I can speak and write in English (I'm Turkish Btw). A little bit. Sometimes foreign customers come to the grocery store that I work. They've surprised to hear an average cashier talking in English, sometimes I make small conversations with foreigners. Some local customers even congratulate me because of my English speaking capability. I want to use this talent at a job. Translator would be a good option. But can I do it ? I don't know. What if I fail ? If I can't be a translator what can I do ? Being in tech industry. For example ; a game designer, software engineer, programmer, information technology, web designer etc... Perhaps I've got a talent for designing a web site. I graduated from web design division of my high school. Maybe I can make an income from this. Who knows ? What happens if this doesn't work ? I've got one more option. Being a photographer or a cameraman. I've had an enthusiasm about photography a year ago. This wouldn't be a bad idea. Being a photographer or a cameraman. What if this doesn't work ? Well, I'm out of options. The only way to get out is death. I'll commit suicide if I don't have a job and career in the future. Let's imagine for a minute. Me, a 30 years old grown ass man, unemployed, his mom and dad were died, his brother and sister left him alone. He's about to go insane. His past haunted him, with failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, bad decisions. He cry every time. He wanna go back to his childhood but he can't. He can't sleep, he can't eat, he just want to be dead. He picks up a gun. Shove it to his mouth, pulled the trigger, and bang ! He's gone. Will he rest in peace ? I don't think so. Because nobody knew about him. As if he wasn't lived. He's just an another fuel for the soil. He'll be vanished. I don't want to be like that. What the fuck I will do ? I DONT FUCKING KNOW !!! I gotta make a roadmap. But I can't. I FUCKING CAN'T. Because some cunt will be a manager or boss in a goddamn job with his father's help. In spite I worked like a slave. Road has some traps that I can't dismiss. May god help me and others.

I finally completed and passed the class that I procrastinated all summer in.,"Over the summer I took an online course that my school offered so I wouldn’t have to take it during my senior year. It was about $200 but in my opinion, worth it. I procrastinated all the way up till tonight where I did all of it in a matter of 7-8 hours non-stop. I genuinely thought I should just give it up and cut my losses but I kept on going. I’ve never been so exhausted in my life and I just turned in my final exam 3 mins before the deadline (I got a 94 D) Would I do this again? Absolutely not, I should’ve just spread out the work over the 2 months. I’m just glad this huge mountain has been lifted from my shoulders. Now it’s time to forget everything I learned.","I finally completed and passed the class that I procrastinated all summer in.

Work related stress is ruining my life,"I work as a manager in retail, for background I’m only 21, I’ve had anxiety all my life and I was also diagnosed with bipolar depression last year. I’m also a college dropout. I’ve worked seasonally at this job in 2017, then came back again in 2018. They decided to keep me and eventually I worked my way up to a manager position earlier this year. At the beginning I did enjoy working here and helping people out. But I have been recently feeling extremely stressed and burnt out from work. As a manager I have a long list of tasks to do everyday, while managing others, and dealing with customers. I would say I’m a hard worker, and getting tasks done is normally doable for me. The thing that gets me is having to deal with people, especially as I am an introvert and work full time so I have little time to recharge. And with the holidays coming, customers are very aggressive and it triggers my fight or flight instincts. I get frustrated when people come up to me to ask a question as it is disrupting my tasks I need to get done, which I feel really bad about. It just feels like an instinct reaction to me that’s hard for me to control. In the past few weeks I think the stress has become enough for me. I’ve had multiple people threaten to call corporate about me for me simply following the rules, one of those people actually did call corporate about me and lied about the situation. I had a woman come up to me acting passive aggressive towards me. My anxiety normally shows itself as anger or frustration, which has become difficult to hide and put on a front for others to see. Got a complaint to my boss from her about me and how I didn’t say you’re welcome for showing her where something was. On top of that we have another manager who has been causing issues, as well as forcing me and others to have to alter our hours/schedule. The final straw for me was today when I got yelled at by my district manager for not completing something. I tried to hold my tears back but towards the end I couldn’t hide my shaky voice. She confronted me about it and I broke down. What really pissed me off is I know she doesn’t care about my stress, she seemed more worried that “there was now a crying manager”. It’s just a bunch of little encounters that nag at me when I try to sleep at night. They build up and I just exploded today. I already know that I want to leave this job. But I really like my store manager and I would feel bad for quitting when we’re about to hit peak season. The pay is also good and I’m trying to save money to move out. But the stress seeps into my personal life and I’m isolating myself and neglecting my life aspirations. I want to be an artist but in order to work my way there I need to be creating. But by the time I’m off work I’m exhausted mentally and physically. I’ve become pessimistic and cynical again. I feel hopeless that if I don’t make a change soon I will be stuck in customer service forever, which makes me feel suicidal. I’ve been looking for other jobs but nothing seems like it would be better. Also when I get complaints, I reflect on it for days and think about myself as a person and how people see me. I feel terrible for not being more welcoming and friendly like I used to be, but at the same time I’m angry at the customers for being rude to me. When it comes to my mental health, I was in therapy when I started the job but left in the beginning of the year because I was doing well. I decided I am going to go back to therapy to deal with my anger and stress. But now I feel my anxiety and mood swings coming back. I worry that all of the stress will trigger a depressive episode, which for me is debilitating. The stress has also triggered mania for me before. I just feel like I cannot be a manager anymore, and I want to leave the customer service industry forever. I’m just scared to do something about it. I know this post was long, but it’s been a rough month for me. I don’t want to bother my friends about my problems but I just needed a place to rant until I can get a therapy appointment. I also wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced this stress and burnout from work and how they handled it. I’ve been hysterically crying all night and I just can’t take it anymore.","Work related stress is ruining my life I work as a manager in retail, for background I’m only 21, I’ve had anxiety all my life and I was also diagnosed with bipolar depression last year.

Feeling stressed like never before,"I’m in college and I have a light load of classes, especially considering loads other students have. It’s insanely difficult for me to keep up while working 35 hours a week, but I have no choice. I need the money. This week I finally got myself out of a depressive episode enough to get work done since I had some extra time off work this week. I was doing good. But I got into a car accident early in the week and I’ve just been so insanely fucked up mentally ever since and stressed about the financials of fixing my car that I have missed several major assignments in a class I was already super behind in. It’s math, a subject I struggle in enough as it is, and I just can’t seem to catch up. I requested less hours at work so I’m only going to be working 20-25 hours a week but my professor just gives so much homework and shrugs me, specifically, off. I don’t want to fail this class. I turn everything in late even if I know it’s taking a good chunk of my grade off but fuck. I’m exhausted and can’t sleep, I have no appetite (I have eaten maybe one proper meal in the last 4 days), and I just feel like I’m at my breaking point and literally nobody understands. Everyone just says “haha me too college sucks zany_face ” but I’m at a point I wish I just don’t wake up in the morning. I don’t know what else to do.

I've tried so incredibly hard and I've finally made it!,"I'm here! I'm smiling again. It's the smallest thing to have gratitude for but I have decided to get help despite my fear of it. I'm in hospital, hopefully all will be better this time. I've got plenty to live for. I (15M) have had a great of help and have been beaten down by my depression. Every day is a battle whether it's to bathe or eat healthy or anything else. A woman saved my life last night and I'm eternally grateful for her.

For the first time in a while I am focused on my dreams and I'm no longer motivated to prove everyone wrong but to rather prove myself that I'm stronger than I thought.",0
Reality is a nightmare. Dreams are my peace,"I didn't want to wake up. I was having a much better time asleep. And that's really sad.

Not sure if I should call a doctor over my work stress?,"Hey all, So, I work in the Social Housing Sector within the UK. It's a really demanding area to work, with a lot of vulnerable clients needing particular arrangements, that aren't always straight forward - and particularly, a large volume of requests and queries that feels never ending, which I guess is the nature of this sector, having a demanding customer base makes it difficult. At the moment, the team I work in is literally disintegrating in front of my very eyes. Our manager left a month ago, this was after two weeks signed off for stress - ultimately making the decision that he couldn't continue to do the job anymore. Following that, our Team Leader then also went down with stress, and is yet to return after being signed off again. To make things worse, two of our colleagues, out of four, are also leaving by the end of this month, bringing us down to two staff left - we on average are getting around about 50-60 emails an hour to our team inbox, and I'm getting around 10-30 in my personal inbox, we also get ""Jabbers"", instant messages, and these are also relentless. It's also worse because I live in a block managed by the Social Housing Provider I work for, and following lock down (and me being a Type 1 Diabetic) I've obviously been working from my flat, which naturally then followed onto having to use my personal mobile to call customers and contractors, meaning this is now ringing constantly. Ultimately, I am starting to feel like I can't relax at home, it's becoming an office to me - and I have no where else I can work, as others have suggested working in a different room, for example. And again, to make it worse, our team is currently under review for lack of productivity, we're trying our best but we're just literally drowning doing tasks that really don't sit with our team, but because I'm 'just an admin' (The head of my departments actual words!) no one will listen, so I'm now experiencing (I think) anxiety over the future of my job, I know that I nearly had a meltdown on Sunday, following a week off, simply over the thought of what was waiting for me in my inbox for Monday morning. I was throwing things, crying, I can't really remember but know that my downstairs neighbour messaged me to ask if I was alright, as she heard the commotion - I covered up by saying I hypo'd, naturally. Alongside the horrible situations I have going on in my job, I am also the sole carer for my Mum, who is depressed and anxious, and makes at least 2 or 3 attempts on her life a month, she was in ICU over Christmas, so I spent my Christmas alone with her on breathing support in a ward at our local hospital. So, my symptoms at the moment; ​ * Feeling hot when I wake up before work, sometimes hot and sweaty at points during the day * Getting really confused over emails, where usually I would know to take a step back, breath, and look at it again, I get overwhelmed now, and lash out/get angry at whatever it is. * Struggling to eat before lunch/dinner time - I no longer feel hungry in the morning, just bloated. * Higher blood sugars than normal in the evening, and morning, but seem to be dropping around mid day, but that may be down to not being able to eat - not quite sure what the connections are between stress and diabetes. * I've been pacing a lot, talking to myself on occasion as well - which is starting to scare me a bit. When I talk to myself, it's always me having an argument with a colleague in my head, but talking it out? I'm worried I am literally 'losing it'. * Massive lack of energy, all I want to do is sleep, but on the other hand, I'm actually falling asleep fine, I just don't feel rested no matter how long I actually sleep for. * My RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) has been going crazy, constantly goes while I work and it's getting harder and harder to stop it, only just noticed I'm doing it right now. * Getting general feelings of being hated/isolated/not wanted by colleagues and friends in the business, and it's becoming an internal battle, where I am fighting the idea of it being true, but I'm starting to feel I'm losing that battle, I've withdrawn from most if not all social events the business holds, and prefer to lock myself in my flat, unplug the internet, and just sit quietly, sometimes in the dark. * I have cried a few times as a result of nasty emails, feeling harassed by colleagues, even though they're not really harassing me - they're doing their job of chasing me for updates, but it feels so relentless and like I can't get any help from anyone, or can approach anyone to talk about how I'm feeling, I fear if I do they may just dismiss me anyways. * Diarrhoea in the mornings, on occasion, can be really severe and foul but clears up by mid afternoon. I'm starting really early in the mornings, around 5-6AM where I can get up in time to get a head start, and combined with not feeling refreshed after a nights sleep I'm drinking lots of coffee, far more than normal. ​ Sorry to waffle on, it's just I've recently used my doctors time for a couple of infections and some help quitting smoking and I'm aware of how busy medical staff are during the pandemic, so I don't really want to waste my doctors time. Is it worth me ringing them? What would be the options I'd get back? Do the above sound like symptoms of stress, and are there any other diabetics here that have suffered with stress, and if so, how did it impact your management of it? I guess I'm more anxious about everyone thinking I'm skiving, but I'm used to that. I felt it the last time I had a hypoglycemic despite the fact everyone saw me black out and told me not to come in the next day so I could rest up, still spent the hold day feeling uncomfortable. Just really don't know what to do, I just want to cry and turn my computer off, I really don't know if I can do it, but I also know, I CAN do it, if that makes sense? I moved roles last year, in the same business, and after just about a year in this area of the business, I just question my ability, whereas I never did before in my previous two roles.

I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand. Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt. I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying.

"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...","About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions. So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus. The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software. The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU. Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is. It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one. Edit Thanks so much for the positive response guys.

Today I've decided to elimate my biggest stress factor my daytime full-time job.,"I decided not to show up. I'm not going back. I worked there for 3 years and I've always felt like a soulless being once I entered the job. I was making $17 an hour at this place, 40 hours a week, $500 after tax. for now I'll be doing ubereats making $20+ an hour.. I will be my own boss and work my own time (temporarily) I know they will be pissed because I'm the only one at this place including the manager that does what I do, but when they presented me a 50 cent raise, I screamed inside. I finally broke free and I feel a little bad about my decision today, but in the long run I know my mental state will be in a better position. I can finally drive my wife to work, and drop off our daughters in school and in the afternoon pick my daughters up and then pick my wife up. This brings me joy. I know how hard it is for my wife to dress two kids in the morning, take public transportation when it's really really cold, raining, snowing outside. That's really hard. I pray everything goes well from here on.","Today I've decided to elimate my biggest stress factor my daytime full-time job. I decided not to show up. I'm not going back.

Failure is so painful,"I've been studying for a couple of years, got my BS diploma and am in the final bits of my master diploma as well. However, I won't be making it. I needed to just pass my internship but due to not being able to finish a report on time (after getting 3 extensions mind you) I got the message that I will be failing. After dealing with corona, studying through looking at my screen 24/7 feeling locked up in my room having to deal with my master thesis was already the worst feeling ever. But I also had to give up my parttime job to do the final internship in order to get my diploma and use up all my savings and I end up with a failure. I can't commit myself to another year of studies either because I dont have the money and I have about 80k in student debt. What the fuck do I do at this point? I've felt depressed for an entire year now and told myself ""just a little bit more"" until I would have made it but that just slipped away. I can't find a job with my bachelor diploma because the field I study requires at the very least an Msc so that diploma is complete and utter useless as well. I have just enough money to last another month and I still have another month of internship left (I got a month and a half extra time as extension to my internship due to me struggling with very basic things like reports..). I received an ultimatum and wasn't able to deliver. What do I do? Just no show? Find a job? End it all?

I've felt depressed for an entire year now and told myself ""just a little bit more"" until I would have made it but that just slipped away. I can't find a job with my bachelor diploma because the field I study requires at the very least an Msc so that diploma is complete and utter useless as well. I have just enough money to last another month and I still have another month of internship left (I got a month and a half extra time as extension to my internship due to me struggling with very basic things like reports..). I received an ultimatum and wasn't able to deliver. What do I do? Just no show? Find a job? End it all? What the fuck is the point of anything anymore.",1
Is it possible to recover from such a traumatic childhood?,"I am only 15, and yet I feel my life is already over. I just have a pit and emptiness in my stomach that I don’t see going away long-term. 4 years ago, my mom killed herself, and I found the body. Safe to say, my childhood was a shit show of fear, emotional manipulation, feeling like a parent to my parent, despair, fighting etc. I live with my dad and sister now. My dad is a really nice guy, but has ZERO emotional intelligence. The other night, I was crying and screaming to him about how I wanted to kill myself and some other problems, and all he did was look at me with a blank expression and say he would call the police. He says he is worried about me, but I have never once felt emotionally conncected to him. I feel empty. My psych told me I have disorganised attachment style which Is apparently the worst. Coupled with the fact that I hate myself like poison and don’t think I deserve that to change, the future doesn’t seem very bright. On top of that, I think I got my mum’s good old depression gene. It seems my life is on a trajectory that is all too familiar. I feel as though I and floating in space, all alone, unable to connect to anyone because of what I’ve gone through. I am far more emotionally intelligent than anyone in my social circle, so while I’m always helping them, I have no one to begin to help me. Interactions are fun, but always empty. Everything is empty. I have no rules or discipline at all. Never have. Don’t care enough about myself to create it for myself. That’s my rant. Any advice?","Is it possible to recover from such a traumatic childhood? I am only 15, and yet I feel my life is already over.

Too Stressed To Do Anything,"I wrapping up my sophomore year of high school, and I have so many final projects to do, exams to study for, and just stuff in general to worry about.

Advice for employee who needs to find problems and manage dozens of small tasks,"Hi all, Hopefully these kinds of questions are welcome. One of the members in my team is an engineer who builds and tests new products. It is normal for him to find dozens of problems - many of which require negotiation with designers, customers and QA folks to resolve. He tends to be stressed out by the long list of tasks because they all require stakeholder input and the timing can be out of his control. It clearly affects him some days so we talk and I try to understand what can be done to reduce the pressure. It’s not an excessive work load situation, the pressure to complete is largely self imposed. We are not an organization that blames people nor has this employee ever experienced consequences for missing an problem or timeline. He just seems to get hung up when there are lots of little follow-ups nagging at him. I’ve encouraged him to be mindful of the stress and try to reprogram himself to have a more positive outlook of each problem that comes up. After all, we view this role as somewhat of a savior organizationally... why dread the inevitable? Design bugs are part of the process. Just today he was in my office venting about how manly people he was waiting on for input and I encouraged him to make lists of open items each morning rather than carry them around for the day in him head. This is something I do as a manager to keep from feeling stressed but he was skeptical. Are there other techniques that I might suggest to help keep the pressure of lots of little tasks from overwhelming him?","Advice for employee who needs to find problems and manage dozens of small tasks Hi all, Hopefully these kinds of questions are welcome.

Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?,"I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out. Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health. I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend.

"Stress is causing pain, which is making stress worse. What to do?","Hi! I discovered not too long ago that when I'm really stressed out, I get pains in my abdomen. I know that it's stress and not something more sinister because the first two times it happened, I was extremely stressed, and I went to my doctor, who could find nothing wrong with me, physically. The pain in my abdomen, while I know is not harmful, still freaks me out. It occurs on the right side, and is often low, which of course makes me jump right to appendicitis. Then I start hyper focusing on that and stressing myself out more, which in turn makes the pain worse, it's a pretty vicious cycle. I am currently on medication for GAD, but it doesn't seem to be doing much to help. I have a doctors appointment in a week and a half and plan on speaking to her about maybe switching medications, but is there anything that I can do to manage my stress until then?

"The worst thing about my stress, is that no one sees the worst stressors.","Hello, ​ I hope I follow the rules as this is my first post here. I just need to let out how *worried* I am rn. I'll put a TLDR at the end because this will be a doosie. ​ The following paragraph is just backstory/who i am ​ I'm 23, straight male, just finished college (bachelor's in General Studies). Also I'm a talented musician and have had somewhat of a small business going for a couple years now, utilizing a variety of instrumental and technical audio engineering skills. I live on my own, single, in a nice little apartment and drive a 2010 Malibu. Music is a legit income, and I also drive as a Doordash driver. I'm fresh out of school and applying for entry jobs in finance and social work. In the meantime, I got an easy job part time at a restaurant my best friend works at. My circle of friends is typical and I have an amazing immediate family (2 bros, 1 sis, all same parents) My credit score is considered 'good' on the scale thingy ​ Seems like I'm doing not too shabby right? HAHAHAHAHAH no. Let me get into my stressors now. ​ Let's start with ones that folks know of. I have PTSD that tends to sideline me out of nowhere. It sucks, but I've been pushing thru since the event happened at 17. everyone who loves me knows the details and supports me well. They also understand that the entrepreneurial lifestyle I have chosen puts a lot of stress on me. They know how hard I work and the sacrifice it takes. I'm the black sheep brother/friend who is always 'too busy'. Along with every human, the coco sniffles have also been a dark cloud over my life the past year or so. ​ So I have mental illness and a busy schedule weighing on me. Join the club, right? Life is hard and I'd say the things above add up to pretty 'normal' stress factors as a human. But these are the tip of the ice burg. Let's break down the real demons below (**trigger warning for addicts**). ​ Let's start with the college thing. Since PTSD had me bed-ridden right after high school graduation, my mom pretty much held my hand and pushed me into an easy college program. I'm not bitter with her, but that in itself could be a whole post. I just question the decision these days because my love for music is pretty much all my existance contains. Most people assume I had a full ride to the degree since both of my older siblings have grad degrees and are doctors. everyone supported my college journey like a 'plan b' as I kept hustlin music on the side. Well, that degree put me 20k in debt and idk if i'll even use it. Time will tell, but it's just eating me alive realizing that for the next two decades I may literally spend 5 Microphone Booths worth of cash on a degree that just sits there. So yea, big debt lingering from school and lots of people don't know the details. ​ Next up, cars. It looks like I own it but I'm making monthly payments on my current car. Those payments are set to go to my sister, who owned it before me, for 9 months (hopefully i pay off early). That one is nothin' compared to the first car I ever bought, which I kinda regret buying. I owe 9k on a 2016 ford focus that is now on a lot because i totaled it in december (remember December - key detail). I had full coverage but the deductable was huge, like 2k. i literally don't know how TF im ever going to pay back the lender if it amounts to thousands and they won't take payments. Being self-employed all of 2020 has me up a creek regarding acquiring loans. I've been denied so many times I'm on hold with it, knowing too many inquiries can ding credit score. The worst thing is that it's MARCH. IT'S MARCH AND I'M STILL WAITING ON A FINANCIAL RESULT FROM A CAR ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN DECEMBER ​ Speaking of credit, I've been excellent at keeping balances low on the 2 small credit cards I have . . . . until about a week ago. This will make sense shortly. ​ Now for the real grit . . . I've been battling porn addiction since around 14. So pretty much 10 years of just trying to get through each day without jerking it to fake people pretending to have sex. I won't go into detail with the porn thing, just know that it's pretty much my darkest vice and with every fleeting moment I ask myself will I ever break the habbit? I mean, I'm not a ""3 hours every night"" addict but I can't stop. I **can't stop** fleeing to it on occasion. I feel like a monster and an out-of-control sex addict. You may wonder, at this point, and to answer your question no I was never sexually abused (PTSD is from something way different) and I've had a pretty normal sex life/dating history. But man, I can't say no to the porn screen sometimes. At my lowest point, which was last week or so, I paid a bunch of money trying to buy sex from snapchat hookers. They all either fell through or scammed me (probably a blessing). If this vice keeps winning, will it get worse? Where is this ***drug*** taking me? I don't like thinking about those questions, because this unseen drug is one of the most life-threatening ones (see r/nofap). It's my secret vice. No one sees it, but it's a constant war. The hookers are where those credit cards went, by the way . . . ​ Lastly, substance abuse. I'm pretty moderate with drinking alcohol and smoking weed, but recently I've found myself wanting to drink and smoke as self-medication. Until recently, it was just a drink here or there with friends. For the first time in my life I am seeing these activities creep in as an escape from reality. This is a new realization, and I haven't spoken to anyone. I could be overthinking this one, but man, I've seen too many victims go off the deep end before even realizing what the heck was going on. To my friends, I know I probably seem perfectly normal. But they haven't seen the couple of times I completely blacked out all alone. While they're at work and assume I'm driving/in studio, that's not always the case. Every once in a while I just mope around smoking loads of weed and watching you-know-what. ​ In conclusion, I feel like on the surface, I look like a confident young man with a lot going for him, and not a lot of red flags. But in my soul I can feel these lethal vices coming to get me. I haven't been this stressed since my PTSD incident at 17. I know this has been a long post, so if you're still here, I genuinely appreciate you. Any comments are appreciated as well. ​ Bless. Stay safe everyone ​ TLDR I'm a pretty normal guy (I think) but finance, porn, and alcohol and weed are starting to stress me out and I'm afraid I'm spiraling into a not-good place.","The worst thing about my stress, is that no one sees the worst stressors. Hello, ​ I hope I follow the rules as this is my first post here. I just need to let out how *worried* I am rn. I'll put a TLDR at the end because this will be a doosie. ​ The following paragraph is just backstory/who i am ​ I'm 23, straight male, just finished college (bachelor's in General Studies). Also I'm a talented musician and have had somewhat of a small business going for a couple years now, utilizing a variety of instrumental and technical audio engineering skills. I live on my own, single, in a nice little apartment and drive a 2010 Malibu. Music is a legit income, and I also drive as a Doordash driver. I'm fresh out of school and applying for entry jobs in finance and social work. In the meantime, I got an easy job part time at a restaurant my best friend works at. My circle of friends is typical and I have an amazing immediate family (2 bros, 1 sis, all same parents) My credit score is considered 'good' on the scale thingy ​ Seems like I'm doing not too shabby right? HAHAHAHAHAH no. Let me get into my stressors now. ​ Let's start with ones that folks know of. I have PTSD that tends to sideline me out of nowhere. It sucks, but I've been pushing thru since the event happened at 17. everyone who loves me knows the details and supports me well. They also understand that the entrepreneurial lifestyle I have chosen puts a lot of stress on me. They know how hard I work and the sacrifice it takes. I'm the black sheep brother/friend who is always 'too busy'.

a random girl at the gym asked me if I was okay today,"ive never been diagnosed with anything, let alone talked to a professional but I have been chronically sad/down/depressed/who fuckin knows for years. ive been going to the gym a lot to try to stop feeling so shitty about (or let’s be real, for) myself. I never talk to anyone- just listen to my music and try to do whatever, but today this random girl asked me if I was doing okay because I looked more down than usual. i told her ‘im good - thanks though”! i knew I felt myself getting worse and I guess it’s showing too. i guess it’s nice that someone asked though, even if i lied.","a random girl at the gym asked me if I was okay today ive never been diagnosed with anything, let alone talked to a professional but I have been chronically sad/down/depressed/who fuckin knows for years. ive been going to the gym a lot to try to stop feeling so shitty about (or let’s be real, for) myself.

Had police called to flat yesterday,"It was my birthday and I felt too depressed to work. I messaged my doctor I wanted to die then fell asleep. Woke up to police at my door. They were super nice. I think I'm probs going to lose my job. That's all. Edit Just realised people must think I'm in the USA. Wondered why this post went crazy. Police in my country don't usually carry firearms, and they were genuinely v nice. Just thought it was unnecessary escalation. They offered to take me to hospital. My depressive episodes are sporadic enough that I can be lucid about them after but while I'm in them my mind is v numb and all I can think of is 'why am I here', and I can't answer. So no need to worry folks, thanks for all the responses. Even if I lost my job I know it isn't the end.","Had police called to flat yesterday It was my birthday and I felt too depressed to work.

When I'm depressed I want other people (very slight nsfw),"I'm using my alt account because of the slight nsfw topic.) Put simply, the more depressed I feel, the more I long for other people. Most of the time I genuinely can't tell if what I want is just simply a hug from a good friend that will never end or to make love with someone all day long. What I do know is that my body just wants the warm touch of someone. However, that alone confuses me because normally I despise being touched by other people. Since I don't know what I want, my confusion just makes me more depressed and the cycle just continues.","When I'm depressed I want other people (very slight nsfw) I'm using my alt account because of the slight nsfw topic.)

I should've been aborted,"I'm nothing but a burden to everyone in my life. I don't have any exploitable talents or work experience that lines up with the jobs I think I want. Besides, every time I think I know what my interests are, they change. It sucks seeing my brother having the high school experience I never had and doing better at some things than I ever did. He's probably gonna go on and do better than me and have a family while I'm gonna work shitty jobs for the rest of my life and die alone. I'm thinking about bringing up the title of this post to my parents and seeing how they react. Knowing them, they'd probably be scandalized. Oh well, it's probably going to come out at some point when I'm drunk.

Found a potential life partner and I couldn't be happier!,"I met this girl on Hinge - she and I instantly hit it off and had long conversations over text. After a few days I suggested a meetup to continue our conversation in person, and she agreed. We met, ate some food and walked through a park while sharing our lives to eachother. The next date didn't go as well - she was in a different state and it was virtual. I wasn't in the right mindspace and it felt awkward throughout the whole thing. I thought I had ruined it. She even picked up on it and suggested we don't date anymore, but wanted to stay friends and maybe meet up after she got back. A few weeks later, conversation continued and we met up again just to hang out and have fun doing something together. Flirting popped back up between us and it felt like sparks were flying, so at the end of the day I asked if she wanted to try again. She was hesitant and said she'd let me know. A few months later we're still dating, staying over at each others houses, having 10+ hour phone calls and more recently have been recording ourselves reciting books, poems and short stories for the other to fall asleep to when we can't be together or on the phone. This is the first time in a long time I've been this happy with someone else, and I really hope she becomes my forever partner <3","Found a potential life partner and I couldn't be happier!

Is it wierd that i have imaginary friends at the age of 16 (almost 17) ... i feel like the ultimate loser,"16f ... cant manage to make friends and get overwhelmed with online friends (. Well i have this teddybear which is a lil bit taller than me and i pretend that he is my imaginary friend (called thao btw... i dunno why) so i watch YouTube videos with him, talk to him when i'm sad/suicidal and so on . Whenever i'm in school, downtown ... whenerver i'm not at home HE is still there and before this corona shit i slept smiling randomly when i had a conversation with him (in my head of course) and those looks (omfg the looks) other people gave me were something else. I havent even told this my close online friends nor my psychiartists because i'm so scared that they will laugh at me. I cant even blame anyone for laughing at me because wtf i'm 16 and while others go to the mall with their friend group i either get panic attacks or ho there with a person that only exists in my head. Besides thao i take videogame charaters as my friends i really really like and kinda adore lol... am i the only one ?","Is it wierd that i have imaginary friends at the age of 16 (almost 17) ... i feel like the ultimate loser 16f ... cant manage to make friends and get overwhelmed with online friends (.

is it the depression or is it just me,"Obligatory I’m on the phone excuse any typos etc. thanks if you’re reading. I’m in my mid twenties. Have been getting help since December of last year.

"being called lazy, useless, and internet addict is a daily routine for me.","before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way.

I do not know what the meaning of life is. When I was younger I was happy to be a good hardworking student but now I'm nothing, I don't have friends to go out and have with I just watch people living life and for me every day is so draining I don't know why I was born, I wanted to study abroad but it's just not possible for me and I just came to know that yesterday so,I mean my hopes are like fucking shattered with life, whether it's in social or like student life ,I do nothing.

I’m so tired.,"I thought when school reopened and normal learning would commence, I’d be ok. That I’d be away from my family, and I wouldn’t feel so horrible all the time. That was a fucking lie, because apparently school is overwhelming as fuck too. I can’t hold a conversation without overthinking, I embarrass myself and act weird, and this sounds stupid as fuck but I’m terrified of the boys in my class. They’re not dangerous or any of that, they’re just so loud I wonder how they can retain so much life inside of them. I can’t do it. The cycle, the heaviness, both physical and mental, my demanding studies. I guess my next plan is to get into a good university, and keep up my academics so I can get a job and move out. There’s this kind of prize ceremony at my school where you can win scholarships, but I don’t know if I should try because I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I failed to secure a good future for myself. I mean, I’m still freshman so I shouldn’t put to much emphasis into my future as of yet. I still have time. But I feel like I’ve been thrown in for a loop because I don’t even think I’ll make it past graduation age alive. I have to get up. My bag is so heavy with the textbooks. My body hurts from all the cuts, and bandages are such a nuisance. My parents are so overwhelming and scary. Im not even that smart of a person. I made the choice of joining this UN council type thing as an after school program. I thought it’d look good on college applications, but I’m a very shy and withdrawn person and I’ve realized I’m probably going to get my ass kicked in any debate. The other students in the council are so much more clear with their words, more accomplished and brilliant than I am. I don’t stand next to them at all. I thought this last year sucked ass. I don’t know what I’m going to do about this one. Thanks for listening to my rant, if you’ve read this far. I bid you a good day","I’m so tired.

"Life is slipping away from me, please read me","I am 19 years old. I am a woman. I am young, I know. I still have a lot of life left, I know. A lot of good things can still happen, I know. In fact, I'm waiting for it, I have been waiting for the future since I can remember because I have had a terrible childhood and adolescence. My life, until now, has been full of abuse from my family, I had a partner who took full advantage of me and traumatized me when I was still malleable, I have had friends who have pushed me aside (not all of them and I have good friends now), and now I am ruining everything for myself as I'm heavily depressed and can barely function. If I'm not sad, I'm angry, and if I'm not angry, I'm numb. Days go by and I don't even notice. I have not had meaningful conversations with anyone in months. I don't remember being hugged so far this year. I have barely done anything in the last months because of how sad and tired I am all the time. I wish I had someone to share, but even if I meet someone I will barely text them back or make plans because texting is tiring to me right now and making plans means negotiating with my weird parents which I have always hated. I have pushed everyone and everything away, even myself. I can't even read nor watch movies. I don't notice the time passing by. I get out of bed and can't bear my own weight from how little life I feel. I don't pay attention in class. If someone asks me something, I answer something nonsensical because my mind is not here. I'm really very, very, very sad. I was this sad before when my ex-partner took advantage of me, but at that point I had friends to lean on. I still have them, but if I look for them now, what am I even going to tell them? *“Help me, I feel like life is slipping away from me”*, and then what? I will just worry them, and they won't be able to help me because we all are so young. Have you felt this way? What should I do? I would like to write, I like to write, but my days seem to go-by in the blink of an eye. What should I do to focus? To feel more alive? With more energy? What has helped you? Not everything is lost for me, I think. I'm very smart, and my mind is very creative, it is my happy place at times, I just can't find the time to express what is going on there bc I'm tired and days feel fast. I honestly don't know what else can helpme right now apart from expressing myself. The pandemic ended my plans to leave home, which was my old only hope to finally feel free of the abuse I have endured all these years and has rotten me to the core. It is still my only hope, but now it is more distant, which sucks haha, to say the least. Plus, I don't really want to leave my little sister and dogs with them, to be honest. I can wait a few more years for them, but dying every day a little bit more on the inside haha. I place emphasis on my home because my parents really absorb a lot of energy from me. I'm scared of ruining my life because of this depression. I'm afraid of becoming a *“she had a lot of potential”* because I do have it. And a lot of dreams too. I just need more energy. That is all I'm asking for. I have even asked the starts. I hope everyone who is reading this is having a good day )","Life is slipping away from me, please read me I am 19 years old. I am a woman.

How do I stop overthinking?,"Overthinking has been a problem of mine for a long time, I have restless nights since I can remember. I don't have any problems with the Past or Letting go, as for letting go somehow was always easy for me, but I constantly overthink every little detail of my life and everything that COULD happen and I can never really live in the moment. My thoughts affect my emotions, and my emotions affect my thoughts, its like a never ending vicious circle. I also noticed that my overthinking starts to affect my relationship negatively. Sidenote I tried LSD not too long ago, because I heard about experiences that helped people with overthinking and/or depression, and for me, LSD worked wonders, for about the next 3 weeks, I really enjoyed life and I was living in the moment, It felt like someone tidied up my thoughts, everything became clear. My thoughts didn't stop 100%, but the little overthinking that I had left seemed so irrational that I could just dismiss it. As beautiful as it was, I don't want to revoke to taking LSD every time my overthinking begins. I always thought overthinking is something that will always stick with me and there is nothing I can to about it, but since I tried LSD and stopped overthinking for a while, I noticed how beautiful life can be as long as my thoughts don't disrupt me from enjoying life to the fullest, and now I really want to achieve that mindset again.","How do I stop overthinking?

Chronic stress relief— PLEASE HELP!,"Hi, I am writing this post because I am— to be blunt— very desperate for stress relief. I am only 19, but about half of my life has been spent trying to cope with things that were abnormally stressful (in comparison to my peers). My parents getting divorced in 5th grade quickly turned into my mother being emotionally abusive, my new stepdad making my mom’s house very unsafe, and my mom taking his side and doing very out of pocket things to try to get us to pity her (pretending to be stalked, faking cancer, allegedly being “poisoned,” etc.)… Ever since this began, I had always followed an escapist route, so much so like that I developed a form of psychosis that led me to believe that this world was entirely a dream (and that I had more control over things than I actually do). I have undergone a lot of persona, mental illness related troubles as well, and it truly seems as if there is no situational stress relief. In February of 2020, however, things took a turn for the worse. Due to extenuating circumstances, I was facing an incredible amount of financial stress, and had to scrounge for money to buy dinner. I started experiencing debilitating stomach pain that doctors could not pinpoint. Quarantine followed shortly thereafter, and then I moved 2 hours away from everyone/everything in order to go to college. I had no money and no friends, and my grades began to slip. My stomach pains got worse, and then I also started to experience sleep issues that make it virtually impossible to wake up on time for work, class, etc. unless I have slept 12+ hours. I have seen so many specialists, to no avail, and these health issues simply exacerbate all of the other familial, academic, and financial burdens I am facing. I have been trying to be as patient as I can, but I have now been told that the majority of my health issues are caused by stress itself. This is a catch-22 in many ways, and this news in and of itself is a stressor. Now, I am hyper-aware of my stress, and feel like I can’t do anything without getting chest pains. I am getting a new psychiatrist and therapist, but my appointments are not for a while, but I am not functional until then! I do things to destress daily (art, talking to my family/boyfriend, etc.) but it’s clearly not enough. Any help is appreciated! Thanks! )","Chronic stress relief— PLEASE HELP!

Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?,"For the first time in my life, I’m looking to get professional help and I’d like some advice based on other people’s experiences first. My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past. My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippled nor do I have friends to help me. My doctor’s visit is under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately, they can’t tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral. I’m planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time and will use all personal part-time money to pay for whatever else. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can’t afford be locked up by my parents. I know next to nothing about going to the doctor’s. So maybe none of this is a valid concern…?","Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?

We lost our baby,My fiancé and I just spent the better part of this week in the hospital after our son was born stillborn at 20 weeks. I had been doing so well before this. I take my medicines. I work. I’m working towards a degree. But now I look around and I don’t see the point. If I didn’t have to take care of her I genuinely think I would kill myself. I’m not religious so I don’t care about any of that. I just truly don’t think I was meant to deal with the things the universe throws my way. How do I even begin to get back to my already fucked up level of normal?,We lost our baby My fiancé and I just spent the better part of this week in the hospital after our son was born stillborn at 20 weeks.

What exactly is wrong with me?,"Of recent I have been really down emotion wise, if I'm not being constantly stimulated whether it be playing video games, picking of groceries, listening to music or watching something on my phone I feel sad, lonley and useless. Sometimes even when I'm doing these things I still feel sad out of nowhere. When I try to go to sleep I stay up for hours just thinking hating myself, sometimes even thinking about suicide (I've had a history of suicidal thoughts and attempting it twice). At times I just wish I could have someone right beside me when I'm really down in the dumps to comfort to, to embrace me and tell me that no matter what happens everything with be fine.

Drinking makes me feel alive and not dead inside,"I get that moods can have an up and down affect. But I also get that drinking can have a negative affect too.

I'm regularly getting compliments about my physique and it's making me feel better,"Tl Dr - skinny kid turned slightly less skinny gets compliments from random people (mostly men) Growing up I was always the weak scrawny kid, it was my one defining feature other than my glasses. I thought it would change once I joined the military after highschool. I definitely got stronger and maybe a little bigger but not by much. Military strength is all about endurance and that doesn't usually make you more muscular. I would go to the gym regularly because I wanted to stay in shape obviously but I didn't really know what I was doing. Again, slight improvements but not a lot. A few years ago I finally got smart about working out, and diet (a little). I love working out so much now, it's my biggest hobby. I've noticed starting last year that I would occasionally get a compliment from a friend or family member about how I look good, or like I take care of myself. This made me feel embarrassed because I don't know how to take compliments. But since then I've gotten more into it, and made noticable gains especially to my arms and legs. Cut to last night, starting a new job at a warehouse. One person who I never met said in a group conversation that he wants to get big like me. Another, who I never met, who's first words to me were ""man I gotta get back to the gym"". People in my unit have been complimenting me on my progress a lot recently too because they remember when I was much skinnier. I'm 5'8"", 160lbs, so I'm not a big guy by any stretch. But it just makes me feel so good to have all my hard work recognized. I have no plans on stopping since I actually feel like I have a long way to go. I didn't know who to share this with without sounding like I'm bragging, but I guess I kind of am.","I'm regularly getting compliments about my physique and it's making me feel better Tl Dr - skinny kid turned slightly less skinny gets compliments from random people (mostly men) Growing up I was always the weak scrawny kid, it was my one defining feature other than my glasses.

Stressful day,"Spoiler alert this post is mostly venting, but any advice or kind words are appreciated. After 4 days of waking up unwillingly early in the morning and being unable to sleep again, this morning I woke up with a chest on my stomach and tingling in my lungs when breathing deeply, as well as general malaise (body pain, not-clear mind, but no fever or bad cough or else). Last weekend I went out for lunch with a couple friends who recently recovered from Covid, and I have also seen my (paternal) grandparents and another couple friends since, besides sharing every meal with my parents. My other grandpa (91 y.o.) - still not vaccinated against Covid19 - is coming back from the hospital tomorrow after undergoing surgery for a tumour and my parents will go there to help set him up, as he'll require care. I am not only unable to go help them, but also hit with anxiety of potentially having contracted Covid and having passed it to them, as well as to my other grandparents and/or friends (who, thanks goodness, are all vaccinated). Plus, I am writing my PhD thesis, which I need to deliver in a month, and I've got no time to waste being sick. I could postpone, but I'd rather not. Plus I haven't seen my (long-distane) boyfriend in a month, he's supposed to pass by for a few days in a couple weeks and I really need to see him, so much that my feverish mind, spinning thoughts at 200 km/h, was thinking how much I'd want to fuck him holding him against the wall and suck his dick (at least some good thoughts). Plus, my bf and I collaborate on a research projects, and another of our co-authors suggested inviting another senior professor to work on the project with us, which would help our chances to publish it in a good journal, but might reduce our contribution to it. I know he and I have somewhat different views on how to manage this issue, but I should decide about it soon and I don't feel clear-minded enough to do so. Plus, I have been somewhat down in the past months (better now) and tend to be needy at times, so I am also concerned that letting him know I really miss him and need him might make me less attractive in his eyes, and he acknowledged he's not very skilled at offering support to me in this instances. I have booked a Covid test for tomorrow at noon and hope it will go well, but anyway better know one way or the other. I just hope (and know) that everything will turn out fine one way or another, but I really do feel alone and stressed... not even unable to cope with things, because I know I can do it, but I'd just wish it were easier to get some much-needed support, especially from my bf who is the most important person I'd want to rely on. Wishing for a brighter tomorrow, and glad to hear any advice you might have on how to better cope with things. As mentioned, I have been feeling vulnerable and easily taken down in the past months due to a combination of factors (Covid, job-related rejections, ...), I am picking myself up but sometimes it still feels hard to cope with all the shit (which, objectively, is not even that bad, given the much bigger problems that many people are facing these days).","Stressful day Spoiler alert this post is mostly venting, but any advice or kind words are appreciated.

I am a 17 year old student in korea and I am stressed overwhelmingly by academics and the SAT. Please read my story and tell my story to others. I am going to jump next week. Goodbye.,"I just finished writing my final goodbye letters to my mom, dad, and brother. Goodbye. I want to talk to someone but I don’t know who. I’m planning on overdosing on lean or some other drug. I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. I’m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply can’t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score, then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home. These days believe it or not, I’ve been doing some things that a regular high schooler should not do like sipping lean, vaping, and taking sleeping pills to sleep at night from the nightmares. I hope I can overcome this, but that time seems to late. Goodbye.","I am a 17 year old student in korea and I am stressed overwhelmingly by academics and the SAT.

My life in a nutshell;,"Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. It's the fear of failure but no urge or will to be productive. It's wanting friends but hate socializing. It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. It's caring about everything just to abruptly care about nothing. It's the feeling of feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb. It's wanting to get help, but subconsciously knowing it won't make a difference because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you are just tired of being in the tunnel.","My life in a nutshell; Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time.

Tired of life,"On empty all the time. Just tired and ready to go. The world’s a mess. So am I. All i see is an endless loop of chaos, greed, selfishness, lies most of it hidden behind a positive disguise and the rest out in the open for people to see. People who ignore it and deny it so they could live in their perfect world. Pure selfishness, no patience for understanding, no time for studying without prejudice, standard set spoiling the mind of some destroying the whole experience of life for all. If most of you died today you wouldn’t know what the truth is because you spent more time trying to ignore it, rather than accepting and trying to fix it. Because it’s just easier to let it all play out that way in your head. Put yourself in other people’s shoes. Care for others. Show appreciation. Protect those who need protecting. Accept the truth. Deal with it. Improve, then live your life with a mind wide open, and with eyes that can actually see.","Tired of life On empty all the time. Just tired and ready to go. The world’s a mess. So am I.

Being depressed and having depression are different.,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this.

Journal for nobody probably.,"Sorry for this long and messy ""rant"", I just wanted to write this down and maybe someone might read it and share their thoughts about this with me.

What's there to say abt why I'm sad about the state of the world...pretty obvious. We're all on a way towards a dystopia and there's no way preventing it...I always dreamt of a utopic future, of a space society sort of thing. I know it sounds stupid but I always wanted something like that. Like a feeling humanity is destined for greater than where we are going but we are not. I also can't bear the thought of living my life to work for 40-50 years from now to get little highs in my freetime... With me myself it's...weird... I feel depressed but I also feel like I'm not depressed enough to get help. Even posting this feels kinda insulting to people here that feel way worse than me. Like I got basically almost everything to be happy so why am I not? I simultaneously love and hate myself. Like I think I'm a good person and stuff but I also hate my inconsequence on...anything. I wanted to quit smoking, I got a vape. I wanted to work out and get healthier, then I waste away in my room playin games and watching the same stuff over and over to get comfortable in familiarity... I want to play the guitar yet I don't practise at all because Id rather play games...I also want to get a partner again but I've left my dating app untouched since I installed it. Never even made a profile. It's always the same shit. ""Tomorrow for sure"" and then I don't. And if I manage to, I stop after a few days. It got even worse since I got busted for marihuana use half a year ago. Weed was always this kind of safe haven to me. I could waste away without remorse and only felt depressed occasionally. And then I'd just smoke a head and thought of something else. Since I got busted I live basically the same life but without this weed distraction. Also now because the bust I gotta fear my apprenticeship and feel like I have to prove something to my employers just to keep the privilege to work there anymore. I can't drive to work or to school anymore for at least the next half year and feel like I'm an inconvenience to my parents cuz they need to drive me everywhere now. Even tho they say it's no big deal and have generally been really supportive. But I also don't want to tell them exactly how I feel because I feel like I wouldn't deserve this extra worry from my parents as they've already did so much for me. I've felt really bad this eve and I just wanted to cry but I couldn't. I just feel shit but not like crying. I just want the time back when I didn't have to worry abt this shit. And even if I feel better tomorrow my motivation won't change and I will continue to waste away...I've thought abt phoning our insurance to ask if theyd cover some sort of therapy just to get advice but I'm scared they won't. I'm also scared I just won't call because I don't feel like it again. I just want to get away. Go on an adventure.

Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares...,"I’m a 50 year old man who is married and has raised two successful daughters. Sounds great, right?

Help with managing stress,"Hi All, I’m hoping for some recommendations/advice. I feel that on a day to day, I now manage my stress pretty well. That is, until something goes wrong and then I fall apart. CBT has helped with managing a lot of daily stressors, but it feels that I reach so quickly to unexpected events, that I can’t put these techniques into action. For example, yesterday, I had a plumbing issue in my house (water flying everywhere). I almost had some kind of breakdown over it. Full on sobbing and panic, beyond what I would perceive to be a normal level. This type of stress/panic is sporadic as it only occurs when there is something unexpected happens. Can anyone suggest any kind of ways to manage this? Thank you","Help with managing stress Hi All, I’m hoping for some recommendations/advice.

I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out. I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness.

Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out. I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself. I also have an evil circle hanging over my head.

Any advice for dealing with debilitating neck tension?,"Hey y’all. I (29M) have been struggling for the last few months with pretty severe neck tension caused from a combination of decades of stress and poor posture. The tension has been so bad, that it’s been shooting nerve pain to my hand, and there was even a brief week long period where I couldn’t move my neck much at all. The only thing that seems to help now is e-stim, and that has only lasted for so long. I can’t really get much restful sleep without constantly tossing and turning at night. I’m writing this completely exhausted, in fact. Other than muscle relaxers, does anyone have any ideas or suggestions as to possible solutions? I’m honestly desperate.","Any advice for dealing with debilitating neck tension? Hey y’all.

Jealous of other peoples lives,"I’m so depressed that it’s gotten to the point where I can’t even be on my phone. I saw one of my old friends post a picture of her college life and just started crying. I even get jealous seeing my own boyfriend out with his friends. I’ve never known what it feels like to not be alone and to have people actually wanting you around. People say it gets better yet most of my life has been spent just staring at my four walls in my room. I feel like I’m wasting my early 20’s but I can’t help but isolate cause I’m in pain. Yet I have to motivate myself to continue to eat (cause I have an ed) and act like I’m fine so I don’t worry anyone. I’m just so tired and this empty feeling hasn’t gone away. I just want to be normal and go to college parties, have tons of friends, and experience things that other people my age do but my fucked up brain prevents it. I’m my own worst enemy. I feel like an empty shell just walking around and hoping for some kind of relief yet it doesn’t come.","Jealous of other peoples lives I’m so depressed that it’s gotten to the point where I can’t even be on my phone.

Headaches and bodily pain from constant stress,"I’m a full time student and have been working part time jobs since I began last fall. I’m 26, no family or safety nets. I have another freelance job but it’s inconsistent and money is incredibly tight. Boss at my day job has been using me as a scapegoat and asking me to do a number of tasks outside my job description. I’m a cook, I wash dishes, I run food, and sometimes have to help the cashiers. Food quality is obviously suffering for this and I am scolded in front of my coworkers throughout the day. She will stand next to me and tell me how to stir a pot, told me I need to ask permission before putting anything in the oven— and I am a trained cook. Then she asks when I’m going to smile for her. I am looking for other jobs, but am not financially secure enough to quit before I do. I try to see my boyfriend on the weekends, but work usually interrupts our time together. This week I was scolded so badly that I have felt ill since I got home— and this was days ago. Headache, anxiety, dread, and exhaustion. I was told I am on the road to being fired, and I have only worked here a month. I’ve been a cook before and have never been in a place with this kind of culture. I’m just wondering how I can survive the stress while I look for another job. My life should be quite good right now, and this job should be very simple! Money and my boss are what drives my stress.","Headaches and bodily pain from constant stress I’m a full time student and have been working part time jobs since I began last fall.

Life is Stagnant,"Hello Reddit, This is a basically a little vent and I apologise if it is in the wrong group. I am happy to delete it if needed. Anyway, I am almost 27, but I can't help but feel like I'm going on 72. This isn't exactly a bad thing, but realistically my life feels like it is never going to change in any major or meaningful way ever again. I graduated from college and can't afford more education, nor I don't have enough money to even save up for a home. I do have enough to split the cost of a cozy apartment with my partner (which we do) and we intend to remain child free, however we do have a lovely cat. Honestly, it feels like the only other major thing we could do is get married, and even if we did, we wouldn't make it some grand ordeal. We'd probably, quite literally just go to city hall together, and then maybe go out for a nice lunch and call it a wedding. Please note that neither of us want it to be a big deal for many reasons and what I described would actually be ideal if we ever did even get married. Outside of that, I don't really even have any talents, hobbies, passions or interests that I really find interesting enough to pursue further. Athough I'm content with that, it just adds to the atmosphere of stagnation. But what fun is it forcing yourself to get good at something if you have no interest or motivation to do so? I also don't have many friends, nor do I enjoy being around people or crowds very much, but even if I did, I don't think the odds of me randomly meeting some dear new friend that will magically change my life forever are very high. I'm used to friends walking away from me after a while actually, and only really have one or two friendships that have stood the test of time. I guess the last thing worth mentioning is that I love travelling, but it's really hard to afford that and fit it in, plus you can't really go far right now due to the Delta variant. Does anyone else relate to any of this? If anyone has any tips, tricks or advice of how to break up the monotony, I'd be happy to hear it. Thank you very much for reading.","Life is Stagnant Hello Reddit, This is a basically a little vent and I apologise if it is in the wrong group. I am happy to delete it if needed.

How do I tell my boyfriend I am actively suicidal?,"We’ve been dating for 4 months. He knows I struggle with depression and anxiety but he doesn’t know how bad it’s been lately.

How do you cope with spiraling? I need help,"Everytime i think about work, i start to get blocked and start to spiral with anxiety. My brain just starts to get so stressed i start to get disturbing intrusive images that will make me go get distracted so i can stop having them, but that doesnt make any of my work disappear, so of course that will make me accumulate work and then have to either work for weeks without rest or have a breakdown and fail on my projects. When i overwork myself, its to a point where i will need to rest for several days after, which can make me go to the ''get distracted and avoid doing work'' phase because my brain just doesnt want to go through several days like that again. But then works gets accumulated, and it happens again. There is no inbetween, im not able to work bit by bit and get organized because my brain is actively fighting against me.

I've lost my best friend,"I've pretty much been alone this past month and a half. My best friend and boyfriend of 2 and a half years told me that we would be taking a short break for his mental health, I know how hard life can be and that his situation also sucked so I after many a tear went a long with it, even though I felt it was a little over board. I love this man with all my heart and soul and I hoped that he would be okay as I know his depression episodes get bad when not delt with quick and I was always there to help when available. After a few weeks I tried texting a few friends (one thing you must know about me is I'm not very popular and don't have many friends and just started at a new school) one friend helped me out the best they could but recently have just trailed off and left me here... during this time, not only was my family involved in so much crap on both sides but many a family member are sick, my car legitimately broke down, my phone broke itself, and I have no one who really is there for me. I'm all alone now... It feels so difficult to do anything, even get up. Now that I've lost my best friend in the whole world after going through so many other trammatic relationships (I was abused in 2 other relationships) I feel like a waste of a person. I feel like him saying he's coming back is a lie that he told me to maybe give me a false since of hope and happiness, but then again I don't know... I really want to believe what he's saying is true but it's almost been 2 months now. I really just feel like my feelings have been disregarded and that I'm always the one who cares the most about everyone, now that they're all gone I don't feel okay... I feel so lonely... I just want my best friend back...I know reddit is a strange place to go with this but I have no good options left and the people here seem like they're pretty chill.

My brain feels literally numb. Is this depression?,"I don’t know what or why this happened but about 8 months ago this all started. My brain just kind of turned off overnight and I haven’t been the same since. I don’t have emotions anymore. Like I literally can’t “feel” emotions, loss of inner monologue I also have no or very little random thoughts, trouble with memory, can’t feel nostalgia, cognitive Dysfunction. Smells and hearing feels dulled. I thought things were improving but I had some stress again and it seems to be amplified again. This seems like something different from depression but I possibly haven’t ever had it this severe.

"“You’re Mexican, depression is a white-people thing, we don’t have time for that”","Yup... This is what one of my closest friends said to me when I opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year I actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. I don’t think I have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. It just makes me laugh now when I hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. Like damn lol. Anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? If so share it, I’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two.

Is mental illness just in your head?,So I’m 20(f) and have a few mental issues. Not to go into detail but I was diagnosed with bipolar and ptsd. My boyfriend is very supportive and helps me out a lot but tells me mental illness is just all in your head and if I really wanted to I could beat it without medication and stuff. I’m not on medication or anything but I’m very depressed and have a hard time just getting through life. So is all this just in my head? I try to be positive but I always go back to the same way. I’m really trying and I tell him that but he believes because he isn’t sad anymore that anybody can just cure themselves of mental illness. I’d just like to know everyone’s opinions or if there’s like actual facts proving that sometimes it can’t be controlled no matter how hard I try. Thanks ),Is mental illness just in your head?

Exercise or activities that physically tire you might reduce your stress,"Increasing the intensity of my exercise helped reduce my stress. I hope this suggestion will help you too. I have been crazy stressed since 2012. It got so bad last year that I couldn't stop over thinking and would get really upset about things. I tried talking to someone, journaling, mild exercise, colouring books, meditation, chanting, etc... everything helped a little but for the most part the stress was still affecting my sleep, motivation and outlook on things. Recently I was out and about with friends, walking in the sun and taking in nature. I was so exhausted by the end of it, that my stress and constant thinking stopped. The next morning I was still quite calm. So I decided to start walking 4km per a day to maintain that level of calm. It's been a week and so far so good. I fall asleep within minutes of getting into bed and I am still calm the next morning. I had to deal with a stressful situation today but I was so calm, I was able to add humour and make everyone else feel relaxed as well.","Exercise or activities that physically tire you might reduce your stress Increasing the intensity of my exercise helped reduce my stress.

"I was home alone the entire day today, so ofc y'all know what that means.....","I cried. I cried almost the entire 7 hours I had the house to myself. I cried without having to hide anything and wherever I felt like. I cried while playing my favourite music loud on my tv. I cried in the balcony, wow that felt good, especially the breeze hitting my face when I stood there nd sobbed. This was nice. My life's an absolute dumpster fire rn nd I'm a fuckin loser, always have been, who's still stuck at his toxic parents' place. No aspect of my life is right rn, be it mentally, emotionally, physically, financially etc etc u name it. True rock bottom. I needed this. I needed these 7 hours of crying nd just sitting nd staring at the blank wall with no need of closing the doors or fearing that someone might catch me. I'm glad I got this.

My life is really pathetic. I do nothing all day.,"Edit slept a lot and woke up to all the comments and upvotes on this thread. Thank you all. I hope life, people, and your mind are better to you and you are able to enjoy your days. Everybody deserves to live and be loved. Nobody deserves this. just turned 22, and here is how the days go. Wake up at some time after having taken Seroquel. Sluggish for an hour. Take Xanax. Stare at phone. Doze off. Think about killing yourself. Lay at a different side of your house. Watch YouTube or listen to music. Try to watch a movie or play a video game but you don't have the attention span. Think negative thoughts. Think about your failures. Eyes hurt. Think about killing yourself. Be ashamed of yourself. State at the wall. Idle on your phone. Take Xanax again. Take Seroquel. Sleep, repeat. Love it. Honestly, I just want to die at this point. Like there is no coming back, I'm done as a human being. My body and mind are broken. I'm non-functioning and the hospital didn't help. I can't focus on anything. I wish I could lose my life in my sleep and give it to someone who could use it for good. I'm incapable of even bathing myself and eating. I have the saddest life ever. I don't deserve this. I just wish my family were OK with it so that I could commit suicide.","My life is really pathetic. I do nothing all day. Edit slept a lot and woke up to all the comments and upvotes on this thread.

idk if this fits here but I just need to talk about this because it makes me feel sick. 3 out of the 7 chickens that me and my 13 y/o sister have been raising since february got killed by FUCKING RACCOONS I FUCKING HWTE THEM,"update one of the cats has been laying with me in my bed for a while. she came in while my mom was consoling me. I love cats. I wonder if they can sense emotion. these birds have been some of the most important things in my life for the past six months.

Yeah, the FUCKING THINGS KILLED TWO OF THEM. They didnt even remove the bodies. they left them there for my poor MOM to find. bless her soul for cleaning them up so i didnt have to see it. I feel like this is my fault. I didnt put out the things that I usually did. I was literally up at like, 3 AM because my sleep schedule is fucking terrible, and my mom said she heard one of them crying at about 4. I couldve checked, but I didnt, now they're dead. I dont even know what to do. Me and my sister have been responsible for these basically helpless lives, and we couldn't protect nearly half of them.

How do you experience stress in your body?,"Hi there! I'm looking for survey participants for my grad school thesis project on the prevalence of different stress responses across the population. Since you are all interested in stress here, I thought you might be interested in participating in the project. Info is below. Thanks so much! Our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh is conducting a research study to measure how people experience **stress**. If you are a US citizen or resident between the ages of 18-65 years old, you are eligible to participate! The study involves filling out some questionnaires about how stress manifests itself in your body. Depending on your unique stress response, the survey could take as little as 5 minutes or up to approximately 15 minutes to complete. To compensate you for completing the survey, you can choose to have your name entered for the opportunity to receive an iPad. You may also elect to do the survey as a volunteer without compensation (i.e., without having your name entered to receive an iPad).

Dumb and confused,"Sometimes I get really dumb, and it bothers me. I’ll have jumbled thoughts, ideas don’t move continuously. I have ADHD, but this feels different.

"Stress Being Expressed Physically, How to Cope?","I don’t want to explain why I’m stressed right now, it’s too painful. I do have it in my post history if needed.

Stay alive! Bad times do not last forever!,"Hey hey, My name is Nico, I am almost 30 years old and from Germany. I would like to tell you all that everything will change. None of these bad feelings will last forever and there is ALWAYS a chance to get out of the hole. My story First depressive episode 2009, followed by addiction to several opiates and benzodiazepines. First recovery 2011 after intervention at a hospital. No detox ( did it at home - very stupid) but psychiatric. Second depressive episode 2012. Recovery in 2014 after intervention at a hospital, again psychiatric. Third depressive episode in 2015. Recovery in 2018 after intervention at a hospital, psychiatric. Fourth depressive episode 2019 and severe alcohol addiction. Recovery 2021 after intervention at a hospital (detox and psychiatric). From 2009 to 2021 I lost three Jobs, fucked up university, wich means I did not graduate and three family members died. I AM STILL HERE! AND YOU CAN STAY IN THIS WORLD, TOO!","Stay alive!

Strings of misfortune,I've had to put in a week sick. At the moment I really can't cope. Every time my life seems good it seems like someone presses a button and everything turns to shit all the time. I'm really sick of it! Aside from this I feel really alienated by society. I feel as though this entire planet is incompatible with my soul. I'm really struggling and I need help.,Strings of misfortune I've had to put in a week sick. At the moment I really can't cope.

How I deal with stress,"With ptsd caused by depression, anxiety disorder and so on from 6 years back. My brain automatically numbs my feelings whenever I'm in a situation where I could be stressed which made me develop alexithymia and apathy so I won't get depressed again. Pretty shitty situation but at least I'm not stressed even though my life is in a much worse place than it was 6 years ago.","How I deal with stress With ptsd caused by depression, anxiety disorder and so on from 6 years back.

Gaming won’t distract me forever,"Lately I’m gaming 6-10 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty. I guess it’s better than wallowing in my depression, but the minute I stop I’m back to suicide ideation. I get it can’t fix my problems, but the anxiety of stopping and letting myself feel is too much. It’s getting bad again. Really bad. And I can’t really talk to anybody in my life about it. I’m not eating, I’m not sleeping, I’m just exisiting at this point and not really living. I just think if I pull myself away from the screen I’ll give into the temptations that keep haunting me. EDIT Wow I honestly didn’t expect this to blow up. Thank you everyone for your kindness, I appreciate it so much. The amount of support through your comments and messages is incredible, thank you so much. I should’ve mentioned I do have a job, it’s a casual job but it pays the bills. And I also do have a therapist, who is also great but I at times feel like I shelter him from a lot of what’s been going on. I have friends and family I could talk to, but with my history of mental health it would just burden them more than it already has. I will try reply to everyone’s comments and messages.","Gaming won’t distract me forever Lately I’m gaming 6-10 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty.

Old heartbreaks can eventually just be nice memories,"I'm sure that this doesn't apply to every situation, but it made me happy to think about today. I thought about my first girlfriend this morning. It was actually because of hearing a song we used to listen to all the time, just driving around our little home town. We were both 16 when we met, and we were together for nearly 2 years. It was a classic story, she got into college in a different state, I couldn't afford to go to college yet, we planned to stay together long distance and it lasted about 3 months. Breaking up with her ruined both of us at the time of course for a few months, that first person you fall in love with does a number on you. I was pretty miserable for a while. For years when I thought about it, it would make me a little sad. Especially if I was single at the time. Then I really never thought about it at all. This was probably the first time I thought about her in as long as I can remember, maybe years (I'm 30 now). This time though I didn't feel sad at all, everything I remembered was a happy memory. The first time we kissed, which was the first time either of us had kissed anyone. Doing absolutely everything together. Sneaking out just to see each other for a few minutes. Climbing an old fire tower in our town, laying out in a field under the stars together. Falling asleep together for the first time. Carrying her around for no reason. Planning all the trips we would never end up going on together. Also, just that overwhelming feeling of wanting to be near someone, and the joy I'd feel when her car would pull up or when she would walk out of her front door to meet me. It's all just nice fun stuff, and it doesn't really matter to me anymore that it didn't work out, and I don't really remember the painful part of it ending. I'm just glad it happened, it was probably the best part of my childhood and young adult years and you can't get that back. In my mind she was the most beautiful, smartest, and funniest person I had ever met, and I couldn't believe when all those feelings were reciprocated. Even if it didn't last, we loved each other. Not everyone gets to experience being in love with someone at 17, its such a pure and simple thing, and I think I'm pretty lucky.","Old heartbreaks can eventually just be nice memories I'm sure that this doesn't apply to every situation, but it made me happy to think about today.

Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding... He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die"" I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back. He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone. I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life. Edit Thank you everyone for the words and suggestions. I have read over each one multiple times. It helps. Sometimes the words from strangers and people traversing through similar waters helps. I will continue to read these.

He seemed nice so I chatted with him a while. I got the sense he might want to ask me out so I tried to casually flash my wedding ring, but he didn’t see.

Workplace harassment,"Hey everyone. So basically I feel that I’m being harassed at work and it’s now affecting my home life because of it. I’m having crazy anxiety going to work, I’m literally holding back tears all day long and have had incidents where I’ve had to go cry in a closet or bathroom, I’m getting chest pains off and on, and overall I’m feeling like I’m loosing control of my emotions. I don’t know what to do, and my doctors advice in the past has been to just “get back on that horse and keep going”. I’ll explain the situation a little. I work at a hospital doing housekeeping. Now covid has been stressful but my management has caused me more stress than covid has. I’m a part timer on a full time line. That means that I have set shifts and hours. My line was Monday to Friday with weekends off. I was working in a covid unit and then was moved to icu to deal with cleaning covid in there. Through that my hours did not change. As soon as summer season started they decided to change my schedule to every other weekend off. The catch there, I was the only one who had their schedule changed like that. Management stated it was because of overtime, however there has been no overtime being offered. On top of that, I have been trying to now get them to switch my rotation of every other weekend off to accommodate my life. I’m in a serious relationship and with this new schedule my partner and I have literally no days off. I addressed it with my management and they refuse to do anything about it. So now my summer is ruined. I also brought this up to the union at my work and they did next to nothing about it. These issues mentioned above are literally the icing on the cake. There are literally so many problems with my workplace. I’m currently looking for another job but with me being so emotional and whatnot I’m really struggling. I just don’t know what to do. I’m feeling trapped, scared, angry, frustrated, and defeated. After 10 years of working at one workplace I really don’t know what to do.","Workplace harassment Hey everyone.

"Give everyone your all, receive none in return. Even if it’s a matter of life or death.","It’s times like these where I realize that no matter how hard I try, I’m worth nothing to these people. God forbid I talk about depression or my struggles with diabetes. I’ve insulted them and their ancestors as well as every God known to man. I hate my self for wanting validation from them. I hate myself for trying to be the bigger better person. I just hate my self. I recently got diagnosed with diabetes, we’re still figuring out the proper dosage for me. It’s super tricky, not enough meds and my blood sugar is always high. Enough meds, my blood sugar crashes hard. When I first got diagnosed my sister threw a fit about how it was basically my fault I got diabetes. Mind you, I’m a dentist, other sister is a dentist, other sister (her bestie) is a physician. She has plenty of medical knowledge. Three hours ago, she called me while I was trying to sleep. I didn’t pick up. She texted me on every platform you can think of. When I answered, she told me she was worried because her BF is “tired” and she doesn’t know why. I told her a number of things and when she asked for details, I told her to freaking google it. She said I was being insensitive. 5 minutes later, I apologized twice and went into detail. 15 minutes later, I hear her going up the stairs to her bedroom. 5 minutes after that I feel “unease”. Check my blood sugar, so low I freaked out thinking I might die there. Not that it would be a horrible thing but if I do go, I want it to end in peace with no drama. I barely get downstairs because I want to make a sugary oatmeal dish and call her to ask for help because at that point I couldn’t see. She threw a fit about me waking her up.

Work environment stress,"So hi. I’m a new ish mechanic in the field. I know some but not all of my job obviously. I’m the green horn. At my job, we have few employees. It’s actually only about 4-5 mechanics, a shop boss and a couple others. For the most part the job is good. Good pay, good training opportunities, good foot in the door. There’s just one problem. One of the most experienced mechanics on the floor, is the grizzled vet type who doesn’t sugar coat things and makes me feel pretty worthless and dumb if I approach them for guidance. The stress or anxiety of even thinking about approaching this man is to a level where my stomach physically churns. (This is not an over exaggeration). Each day I dread more and more, going in to work. I’ve never had to deal with this kind of environment, stress, or person before.

"feeling stressed and anxious about life, and it really hurts.","I'm a 19-year-old girl, a senior in college. and my existential crisis is getting worse. as a kid, I've been traumatized by death. I remember clearly the day I learned what it was. I was maybe 4 or 5 years old in a museum (my dad loves visiting them), and I always hated going there because it was very silent, and spacious giving me the feeling that I had swallowed a bowling ball with a million knots in my stomach. The statues looked so real to me, I thought they were real people staring at us. One of the statues was very intriguing, it was a woman on a bed being surrounded by angels. I asked my mom what it meant? She answered saying it's most likely she's dead and the angles help her ascend to heaven. And of course, I asked what's death? And she said it's when you leave this world, someday, and you go to heaven or hell. This freaked the hell out of me for so many years. Mom told me that no one knows when we'll day, it could happen anytime. This made of fear the future. This nothingness that is death is terrifying, to me, even heaven seem scary. Like I always imagine it as a boring white place with nothing going on. I'm more of agnostic, very confused about everything. I got into counseling to deal with the stress of the uncertain rather than my existential crisis. It got better and try my hardest to be excited for the future because there's so much that I want to do and achieve. But now, it's coming back and making me feel like absolute shit. Because I'm realizing that I'm no longer a kid, I'm an adult, being taken away from those days. I really scared of dying, absolutely terrified. Everything I do now seems meaningless, the things I love like makeup and taking care of myself. I always feel guilty if I waste my time being on the internet, but then if I not doing that I would be reading a book and even that seems unnecessary. I'm afraid of turning old, afraid of the future. On top of that, global warming is making life more anxious. I don't want to live at a time where the world might end in such a terrifying way. I'm making my best to help the environment. But many don't take that seriously. I'm also afraid of wasting my youth away. I have strict parents, so I don't get to go out with my friends, do things alone, and I've never experienced love. I know women who are now in their late 30's stuck at their parent's house being sad. I don't want that. I want to move out when I have a job, live in another country. But with parents like mine (strict muslim household) they'll refuse. And I'm so scared of doing that, that I won't be happy, filled with guilt, or that it wouldn't work out. Plus, my parents, I really love them, don't want to leave them. But if I stay with them, I won't be able to live my life to the fullest. So I'm in a dilemma. I have to make a decision somehow, because time is running, and must not spend my time chickening out. But I'm in a dilemma. My head is a mess. I feel very hopeless, miserable and anxious. I feel very lonely, would love to be hugged and loved. My faculty happens to be only female, I don't feel that connected to them. And the only friends that I have are far from me, one is on another continent, and the other isn't in my faculty, very busy with work. Where I am isn't great, it's a country with many issues, and I'm the only foreigner in my uni. The place is quite dangerous, you can't go anywhere without a car and we don't have that. So I'm stuck at home with my thoughts to fuck me all over. I really miss Europe, that's where I grew up. Really hope to move out to somewhere great.

Happiness really is a privilege,"Growing up I never thought about it like that. I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn’t happy was some outcast. Now I see happiness really is a privilege, and I don’t say this in spite. If you are happy, that’s amazing, but also I think there are a lot of people who don’t realize how lucky they are to be happy.

I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn’t happy was some outcast.

"Severe stress, I literally feel crippled, cannot stop throwing up","I am a 34 year old female. I have had quite a year to say the least, amidst all the other nonsense going on (covid, riots). I am also in the middle, hopefully near the end, of a messy divorce with an extremely resentful ex (no kids, thankfully). Due to me moving out on my own, I started to have some financial issues, then it just seemed to snowball. I got into a fender bender in my brand new car, have to pay a $500 deductible, and unfortunately still pay my car payment (I was honestly hoping it would have been totaled and got me out from underneath the loan). Then I started to get a sinus infection and they made me test for COVID (which was negative, but I had to take a week off work anyway). I just can't seem to get it together and I literally feel like I'm killing myself with all this stress and nonsense. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin all the time. I get very disoriented and ""dumb"", feel like I'm in a dream, debilitating anxiety, muscle twitches (specifically my right eye), shaking, exhaustion, can't get my thoughts straight ever (I seriously cannot remember if something actually happened lately, or if I dreamed it) ,and lately, just throwing up constantly. Going to work is a nightmare (I'm an insurance broker - and have been for 4 years), but I've missed a lot of work this year and all of my co-workers pretty much hate me. The thought of sitting chained to my desk all day makes me crazy, but I know I need to go because I need money. It's a non-stop shit show. The only thing that seems to help is alcohol, which ***trust me*** I know, does NOT help. I can't live like this anymore. I know there's a happy, fun girl in there, but I'm so lost. Currently, I'm on 100mg of Zoloft which seems to be doing nothing. I was taking Mirtazapine briefly, which is great for sleep, but not so great if you're trying to watch your figure. What are some things you guys do to manage your stress? I literally feel like I'm losing my mind.","Severe stress, I literally feel crippled, cannot stop throwing up I am a 34 year old female.

Opening up “too much”,"Hi everyone, I need so advice or words of encouragement I already feel bad enough with myself. I feel like I have made a mistake and potentially messed up something good. I recently met this guy on tinder, I have never been a fan of the app and my conversations don’t usually last long with anyone. But this guy and I clicked instantly, we both want the same things, are very similar and there seems to be a lot of chemistry. Where I’m from, we are in lockdown. We started talking two weeks ago and haven’t met yet, been talking everyday pretty much all the time. I had some bad things happening the last two days, my dog got very sick and had to take her to emergency vets, I was distraught and terrified of losing her. Then my parents told me they’re divorcing. Anyway so that plus my depression, bipolar, anxiety and other mental health issues I have found the last two days really rough. So I opened up to this guy, he’s been really understanding, comforting and has really been the best. However I opened up about some serious stuff about my past, overdosing, and other things. I feel like I have opened up too much. I have extreme anxiety I possibly have messed this up. I know we haven’t been talking long and it terrifies me that I’ll lose him because I just dumped all my shit on him. I didn’t mean to, I was just being honest and he encouraged me to talk about it, but I don’t think he knew how serious it’d be. I told him I would talk to him tomorrow because I didn’t want him to think I was doing this to make him feel bad for me or for attention. I have pushed away people after opening up, I guess it all was too much for them to handle. He just said “oh” and reassured me I was being silly and it was okay. But that was it, I asked him if he was mad and he said no, I asked if we were good and he said yes. After that he just said good night and that he hoped I felt better and had a good sleep. Have I messed this up? My anxiety is telling me so and I don’t want to mess it up, I regret so much opening up. I knew it’d be too much but he insisted and don’t think he was ready to hear it all. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I feel like I'm watching my life crash and I can't stop it,"This all started in October. I lost my mom on the 11th, that alone is still hard to deal with. She was my rock, my person to run to when I was stressed or couldn't figure how to handle certain things as a parent or as an adult. There were understandably missed days of work, which caused lost wages. Only two days were covered for me and my husband was out of vacation days, none were covered for him. This caused us to fall back on a few bills. We live on a tight budget as it is, there was no insurance for mom, so no way to financially put back our wages. It started a slow spiral littered with late fees. And then came early December where we had a choice of keeping our place to live or keeping our car, we lost our car. Luckily my dad was able to step in and was helping us get to and from work until we could get a car. But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom. The hospice nurses (oddly the same ones who saw my mom out) have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesn't want to leave his side. So here we are I'm about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired. My husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work. but I work the overnight. No one is willing to help me get there and home. We have called taxi services around us. It would cost over 100 for him to get to work and back and close to 50 for me. This is crazy and I'm so nervous. Everything at once, I'm worried about losing my job then losing the roof we fought so hard to keep over our kids head, we gave up our car to keep. No matter how hard we work no matter that both of us have rarely missed days and worked for the same companies for years, both very good workers but one horrible moment in my life has us standing on the edge of losing everything. We make too much to ask the state for help but not enough to miss a few days to grieve the loss of the best person in our family without ruining our lives. I'm just on the edge and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do anymore and the one person who would know, who could help isn't around to help us. Thanks for listening well reading I guess.","I feel like I'm watching my life crash and I can't stop it This all started in October. I lost my mom on the 11th, that alone is still hard to deal with.

Does my depressed girlfriend realize (rather than feel) that she loves me?,"Hi everyone, My (31M) girlfriend (28F) of 4 years suffers from depression and she's currently going through a rough period. I have never understood depression and I have accepted that I never will so I just try to be as supportive as I can with information from places like this subreddit. However, one question that I've always had and was afraid to ask why can't she own up to it? She is currently going through tough times. These days, she does not feel love for me (or anyone else) and is completely miserable. This is something that I can accept as being depression. But why can't she just say something like ""I know that I love you, even though I don't feel it."" or ""Thank you for taking care of me, I know this must suck for you""? She could even say ""I know I don't feel grateful right now but rationally, I realize that you are amazing for taking care of me"". One small sentence like that would mean the world to me and I can't imagine that she does not realize this. I hope this post won't be interpreted the wrong way. She is struggling with something horrible and I am complaining about wanting some compliments on the internet, but some days I feel like I can't take this anymore. Thank you to anyone who reads this. EDIT a few hours after posting this with a throwaway account, she texted me a heart. No explanation, no words, she's still unresponsive in her bed. This is the absolute highlight of my week.","Does my depressed girlfriend realize (rather than feel) that she loves me?

My family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health.,"A bit of background My sister struggles with mental illness to the extreme, we're talking cops at our door, constant trips to the hospital, alternate schooling and the whole lot. She needs 24/7 supervision and we have to have everything locked away out of her reach at all times. I currently live with both my mom and my sister and needless to say its very overwhelming dealing with her. Me and my mom have a hard time keeping it together and my mom will often turn on me due to stress, and since I have no outlet it makes going to work near impossible because I just sit and get angry about whats going on at home. Now suddenly our landlord turned around and sold the house, weve lived there for over 13+ years, been good tenants and always paid rent on time, he gave us no written notice and has made our life a living hell. Its all super illegal but thats a completely different story. We have 2 months to leave, our original plan was to get a 3bdrm and split it but due to high housing prices (we live in a big city) and landlords are ridiculous here, super scummy, they try to charge for many illegal things even asking hundreds of dollars just to fill out and submit an application. Even then its not a guarantee and half the places are bug infested and in the centre of crackhead central. Ive suggested to her that she finds a cheap 2 bedroom in the city for the time being with my sister. She needs to stay in the city or my sister loses all her support workers, schooling and the lot, its a 2 year waiting list minimum to get back in a program even if we provide transportation because the city will no longer cover it. I drive and work fulltime I can go where ever I want. My mother however doesnt drive and is currently laid off due to covid. I dont want to deal with them anymore, the constant violent out bursts, the screaming and crying, everyone at my work thinks im crazy because im always crying or throwing up from stress. I had to go on stress leave before this because the physical effects from stress was making it impossible and dangerous to work. The dizzyness and vomiting and the whole lot. Now when I suggested going our seperate ways to my mom I offered to help her in any way she would need including money and transportation to whatever extent I could spare, it ended with her screaming and crying that I was abandoning her. This makes me feel terrible but also makes me lean towards leaving even more. What route do I take? I know moneys already very tight for her and I love her but living like this day to day is literally killing me and I want to grow as a person and live my life. Tldr; my family struggles with mental health and I have the option to leave for my own sanity but it means abandoning them in their time of need.","My family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health.

Is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning?,I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know.

I am just a huge disappointment,Hello. Just wanted to make a post because today was a pretty sad day for me. I woke up this morning and went to the bathroom as its usually the first thing I do every morning and when I walked out I overhead my dad talking to my sister about not ending up like me. Obviously this hurt and usually I don't cry much but this morning I cried like a bitch. Hearing my dad say that to my sister really fucking hurts. Ugh. He says that he loves me but sometimes I don't know how true that is. I just wish that I didn't exist. I've been depressed for years and nothing has changed. I have lost nearly all my friends because I'm a complete loser who is addicted to smoking pot because its the only thing that can temporarily cover up the sadness. I'm starting college soon and my parents don't have any faith in me and honestly I don't have any faith in myself. I could barely pass high school because I have 0 motivation. How in the world would I be able to pass through college. I don't know how much longer I can take this shit... I've seen a therapist but she just told me and my parents that my internet use was the problem. Like really??? She was completely useless and I haven't seen one since. I live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and I have everything I could want. A gaming PC. A high end smartphone. A puppy. And life still is just as mundane as usual. The only thing I have to look forward too anymore is smoking a bowl at night. Fuck. I'm starting to get suicidal thoughts and this is becoming really scary. I don't really know why I'm making this post I just wanted to get it all out I guess. I'm just tired of being a lonely loser who has 0 skills I guess.,I am just a huge disappointment Hello.

I started a new job today and I can honestly say things are looking up ),"I started a new job today. Im in Michigan and the place Im working is a marijuana cultivation facility. The pay is good, the benefits are good, and I get paid to play with bud all day. Moreso, I am so proud of myself for starting to get help and work through my issues. I started some meds to help with my depression and because of that things have been getting so much better. I am actively trying to do better with my life, be healthier, eat healthier. Getting a new job is one of those things that made me open my eyes. I was working in a dead end place before. You can't go anywhere with McDonalds. You can move up into a management position but that's more than likely the only place you will go. At my new job, it's such a growing industry (heh heh) that the opportunities to grow as a person are tremendous and I can't wait to learn everything there is to know. Anyway, I don't have many people I can tell, so I thought I would tell you guys. Thank you for letting me share my excitement. For once in my life, I am actually able to say I am a happy person. It's been so long for me to get to that point and I'm incredibly grateful for where I am now. There is still so much hard work to do on my end, but things are getting better.","I started a new job today and I can honestly say things are looking up ) I started a new job today.

Can you be severely depressed and high functioning?,"I keep taking online quizzes for depression and I keep getting severely depressed, but I think if I'm depressed I'm high functioning. I don't think most people would think I'm struggling. I seem like a happy person, do well in school, get stuff done, but it is so hard to do every day. I think the only thing that motivates me is my anxiety and guilt.

I have no sleep.,"Ever since I got in my second quad master, everything went out smoothly. But there was this project I had for the design course that took me the whole Christmas break to do. (I only had 2 weeks of that break) Since it was a plushie project, my teacher expects us to have a sewing machine at home. I didn't have one so I sew it all by hand. I would stay up until 6 am to work on it then wake up at 8 am to sew again, by doing all of that myself I pushed back all of my other units for my other course and now I have fallen behind a lot.. I would always make a schedule for my day but then I have interruptions such as how my mom would get mad at me for not getting my work on time then goes on to say she's gonna take my electronics away? IDK she's gonna make me fail either way if she ever does that again. Then I have a boyfriend that I've been with for a year and a few months now, in October 2020 he did a suicide attempt and I felt so useless not being there in person. Which of course I broke down, didn't do my work for the whole night, didn't eat anything, and when my mom walked into my room when I had my break down and she made a happy expression that I broke up with him. I told her about it and she didn't care and left my room. 2 hours later he was alive and well and I felt relieved but now I feel more paranoid that he would do that again. People say that taking breaks is good when you're stressed. But I can't take any breaks, I'm behind in my subjects and I only have this week and 3 more weeks until I have to move on to the next quadmester. After that, outstanding work from that unit will become a 0.","I have no sleep. Ever since I got in my second quad master, everything went out smoothly.

So stressed I feel like I’m drowning,"I’m in my mid twenties (F,25) and living with mother. Lately all she does is say negative things about me and it really puts me down. I feel like I do everything wrong. In my work life, my love life, social life, everything. I was dating someone new and we recently broke up. It was so abrupt and the circumstances suck, and now we aren’t talking after getting into an argument. It’s hard to not let it get to me. I keep thinking what if I had been more supportive? What should I have done to fulfill their needs while grieving...they say they won’t date anyone else but what if they’re lying .. thoughts keep racing and making my heart beat fast I’m still unsure what I’m going to do career wise and if I can afford to live alone and if I won’t feel anxious living alone...

Grey hair suddenly?,"Hi all, I know that researchers found that stress causes more/faster greying of hair but wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else had experienced this first hand as well. Almost 12 months ago now I went through an incredibly traumatising and permanently life changing experience. I have since suffered what could only be described as ongoing severe emotional stress which only now is showing the slightest signs of easing. Before the event I had no grey hair on my head. About 4 months after the event a lot of greys started growing in and this has progressively gotten worse. It is now almost twelve months later and I would say around a third of all hairs on my head are now grey! My skin and face look much older as well now, but the speed of the change on my head has shocked us all. Anyway I definitely agree with the findings linking stress to rapid greying. Has anyone else experienced something like this? And how quick did it come on?","Grey hair suddenly?

"Severe anxiety, derealization, agoraphobia, depression...","Hello good people, I hope u are having a great day, and u will have the patience to read my post. I'm not native english speaker, so I apologize in advance if I make some errors. I am writing this post, which is more like a cry for help, during a time when I feel like I touched the bottom of life. I have struggled with anxiety pretty much my whole life, without knowing it in my childhood, everyone around me, as well as myself, thought that I was just a shy and insecure kid. Everything started very early in my childhood, I was around 6-7 years old when I had to go to school, but could not do it, and in many different occasions I felt very anxious and started having derealization, which I had no idea what it was back then. I would have go home when I felt it and it was going away. Always when I had to do something new, or something where I felt uncomfortable I got anxiety and sometimes derealization. Almost never I could go on a vacation, or on an excursion and relax and enjoy it fully like everyone else, the feeling was so strong that I almost always had physical symptoms, I would feel sick, or had to go to the bathroom and my whole body was stiff, could never fully relax. My whole life I was involved with sports, and this mental issues prevented me from giving my 100% in sports. Things got better when I was around 12 years old, I had many friends, I felt very comfortable in school, had a lot of fun and almost the whole day I was outside with my friends, playing and having fun, so all this mental issues were reduced significantly, life seemed normal again. But then, when I had to start in high school everything changed, I lost almost all of my friends (they went in different schools and everyone found new friends) and I could not go to school anymore, I could not adapt and the anxiety went through the roof, so I started isolating myself at home. Btw I live in a third world country, so not going to high school is punishable, u have to pay a very big fine. So the people at the school, and some relatives, tried to scare me, saying that my family was going to pay a big fine etc, but this made me even more angry. After this, life never really returned to normal, I spent most of the days at home or in the house of my grandparents, had no close friends and never have been in a relationship in my life. But I was feeling very comfortable at home at the beginning but very soon it took its toll. I developed OCD (again without knowing what it was), I'm sure many of u are familiar with this term and know what it is. I struggled with it for many years afterwards, plus the severe anxiety. I managed to solve it (OCD), pretty much completely, on my own. And then the life gave me the biggest punch. First, my grandpa, with whom I was very close, got sick and died, which had an incredibly big impact on me and 2 months later my father had a stroke, which fortunately he survived and recovered from completely but the trauma that I went through was very big. In those times I had almost no emotional support, I was pretty much left on my own, to go through that period. I did not want to bother my mother to console me, because I did not want to show any weakness in those times, when she was too devastated by that event. So I went through all that period with my head held up high and then when it all settled, the s\*it hit the fan. Severe anxiety, OCD and derealization came back. The derealization became so strong (and it still is) that I cannot fight it, every time when I leave my room.After that I started having panic attacks which led very fast to agoraphobia. Now, for the last 5 months I'm almost everyday, 24h in my room with very little human contact. I take a shower rarely, and sometimes it feels very difficult even to change my clothes. So far in my life I have been on 3 different medications, and Ive seen many psychologists/psychiatrists, including hypnotic therapy, but the anxiety seems to have won against everything. I was very religious pretty much my whole life, going to church, praying but now I know that I completely lost my faith. The most beautiful thing that happened to me in the last few years is the girl that I met few weeks ago online (she lives in a neighbouring country) and I immediately felt connection, and now can say for sure that I felt in love, after many many years, and it seems that the love is returned. But on the other hand, what makes me sad, and I write this with tears rolling down my face, is the fact that with all this mental issues I cannot make her happy, I cannot have a normal life, even though she says that she loves my company. Suicidal and self-harming thoughts have been regular in the past few months along with the depression. I lost interest in many things that I loved. I think I said enough, I opened my heart and I don't even know why I did it but maybe somebody can relate and give some help or maybe this post of mine is going to be helpful for other people. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this, and I really hope that all of you struggling with mental issues will find a solution and get your life back.","Severe anxiety, derealization, agoraphobia, depression...

My life is a mess and I don’t think it’d be worth the time to clean it up,"I’m new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far. I apologize for the lengthy post. My depression started late in my sixth grade year. It began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking. By the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of Washington. Once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school. My first day at the new school felt unwelcoming. Most people generally ignored me and the few that didn’t were very manipulative, using the fact that I was new to bolster their reputation. By the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break. Most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights. Nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfather’s stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather. Later that night I had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day. The rest of the summer flew by, leading into the next school year. I was still relatively new to the school so I was still in the same circumstances I was last year. A new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting. Late November I was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes, this would continue to the next school year. I still hadn’t made any friends, only interacting with others when I had to. During lunch breaks I usually sat alone, sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member. The end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school. This summer was uneventful besides summer school. My friend didn’t make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so I just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room. 8th grade was like 7th grade only differing slightly. My period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts, paranoia, and anxiety. During group activities I struggled with speaking to others, finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly. I became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects. Later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as I slept during science class. I broke my silence and started to berate him. This left a lasting impression with some of my classmates. After that day I started to focus on my anger. As time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive. Not long after, I got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class. He said something that I took offense to so I grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers. After that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that I was going to fight him. The summer was the same as last year. Summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me. I again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression. My freshman year began slightly different. I had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me. She was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother. My depression dramatically increased in late November when I developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood. I became self destructive, insulting my appearance and intelligence. I came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears. I convinced myself that I wasn’t good enough for her and that nobody cared about me, that I was worthless. A week before Christmas break I had come up with a new plan to kill myself. The last week before Christmas break was unbearable. The thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind. Thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day. The last day before break during first period I broke down in tears. I went to my councilor and confessed that I was going to kill myself after Christmas Day. I was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression. I the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior, some acting, good attendance to activities, and the fact that Christmas was coming. I left being prescribed Zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while. Christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different. In mid to late January I began getting migraines from taking Zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine. Not long after I then started to prepare for Valentine’s Day. A couple of days before Valentine’s Day my friend and I went to get some flowers for my crush. I had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the 17th. We met up that night and I confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability. She told me that she didn’t feel the same way and friend zoned me, we haven’t spoken since. I broke down in tears later that night, spiraling back down into my depression. I would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession. Covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship. Around mid May I stopped taking my medication thinking that I didn’t need it any longer. June through August made a great amount of progress on myself. I began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work. This would last until November. I quickly fell back into my old habits, constantly degrading myself. In late November I found out how my sisters truly felt about me. They felt nothing but hate for me, doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge. In December my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that I’ve changed for the worst, that I wasn’t her son, wishing for the “old me” to come back. She than grounded me and took all of my possessions. She would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if I didn’t comply. This would continue throughout January and end in early February. After that happened I began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to. By March I had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again. They helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing. In April I started working and hanging out with my friends more often. By May it all fell apart. I had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day. They thought that I was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me. As a result I lost all of my friends and almost lost my job. Since then I’ve kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns. I’ve apologized to everyone since but I still hate myself for everything. I’ve felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again. I hope that I can get some advice or at least get some comfort so I can try to get back on track","My life is a mess and I don’t think it’d be worth the time to clean it up I’m new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far.

I feel like I've won the lottery of life,"I live in a beautiful city that most people vacation in. I finally went back to school full time for a degree I think ill enjoy. I can fully support myself without working at all and don't rely on anyone to take care of me. I have more than I ever imagine I would in life. I really didn't think I would be ""alright"". My parents even told me they had almost no hope for me and didn't think I'd make anything of myself. I have done well enough in 10 years that I'll never be forced to work again unless I decide I want to. I have no idea how I even managed that as it was never my intention. I looked in the mirror this morning and couldn't stop smiling. I feel so blessed and am so proud of myself for never letting anyone stop me or hold me back.

Advice,"So I’m 13, going into freshman year, and I have no options left. I have been dealing with severe social anxiety for about 3-4 years, and I’ve worked with multiple therapist and yet nothing in the way of coping mechanisms work, to the point I despise anyone who tells me I need to find one. I feel like going to stuff like JUUL would be my only option, considering they work for all my friends. Please can anyone give me a little guidance please. School is hell for me.","Advice So I’m 13, going into freshman year, and I have no options left.

My upbringing,"I don’t know yet if this text is self-therapeutic or I’m looking for opinions. Probably both like always. My upbringing was fine. My parents don’t fit together too well and their relationship is nowhere the definition of “healthy”. But there was no physical violence, we went to vacation and we had enough money to buy everything a family needs. With that being said, i never developed a deep emotional relationship to my parents. I never talked about emotional issues with them. Or emotions and feelings in general. Myself evolved into a egotistical and narcissistic personality as soon as i hit the age 6-8. I have no clue why.I definitely developed a fragile ego until I was 10. But things just started there. I was still one a high horse. In my class i was the first boy with a gf. (14yo). I was in love with her, but 4-5 months into the relationship i got kinda bored and ended it. I restarted it a few times because i was impressionable (the bigger and older guys in my basketball group said i did a mistake), but a few months later i was still abusing her love for me just to make out. You see, a very fragile but self-centered ego. The next 2 years i continued having “relationships” with girls. I also changed school because i was lazy as fuck. In retrospect this was the worst decisions of my life. With 16-17 i started going to parties, i got wasted a lot. I met my todays best friend. I also met this boy. He was from my old school, same year but different class. Therefore i didn’t know him yet. We we’re chatting a lot, we hit it off immediately. And very soon i realized i like boys. He gave me weird signals, we cuddled and so on. But eventually he made it clear he is not gay. The last 2 sentences outline like 6-7 months maybe more. When we we’re at friends we cuddled, we played footsie. It never happened much more, at least nothing i have to add here. As i said, eventually i told him. He said nope, unfortunately we still met and even more unfortunately. We still cuddled. I couldn’t finish this story. And this is when things heated up. I got wasted more and more, i got drugged up. I can’t specifically remember the precise timeline. After intense alcohol sessions and weed, mdma arrived as well. I did way too much mdma. Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, cocaine, medicaments, acid, ketamine. Everything. I wasn’t addicted to one specific substance back then. I was just permanently drugged up. Of course wrong friends joined my life, the good old circle appeared, which our parents have been warning us since we’ve been kids. Suppressing my emotions was the target. And i can’t say i didn’t achieve that. The rock bottom was new year’s eve. My best friend said we’re done until I’m not completely insane anymore. Since the boy i fell in love became very good friends with my best friend and we were going to parties altogether, i got extremely jealous. I tried to separate them. I got aggressive. This led to the message of my best friend on new year’s eve. Luckily i had a few brain cells left, and this was a turn point in my life. I tried to get my shit together, over the next 5 years i did less and less drugs. I wasn’t as pretty as before because i fucked up my body, so i also looked for a healthy life style. I was very insecure of my look for years. I didn’t date anyone, even though i believed i had overcome him . I didn’t care anymore when he was around. I passively began to dislike him. The last 3 years i was catching up my a level. (Since i left the school with 14 and i only did 10 years of school instead of 12-germany) In this time span my main issue was weed. I smoked for 3 months, then i was literally sober for 2-5 months. ( not even drinking coffee or a beer). I repeated that several times. I barely saw this boy the past years. 2 months ago i finished my a level. I also was sober for 10(!) months and besides school i was working 160 hours as a nurse in an elderly home(to this day). After the exam I obviously started smoking weed again. But this time not the whole day without going to work. Only after work; only one joint. Well it bored me that much, that i flushed down 50 bucks of weed. I guess weed is history. But a few weeks ago i saw him. And what can i say but “the first cut is the deepest” It’s been 7 years. And i still love him. Never believed he is not interested in boys. I think the past years when i tried becoming a better me, i actually got a few emotions back. The past two months i became more pretty again, i healed . I felt the higher testosterone floating through my body. My interest in relationships increased, tho i didn’t look for it now. When i met him, i guess i just realized i never closed this chapter. The next few days i was high af (on him and weed- i still smoked back then). Then the low point eventually appeared. And i don’t know, i feel like shit now. Depressed. I don’t care if i die tomorrow. I don’t care if i go to jail. The past years i had actual symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. (No, im not that edgy kid who thinks sociopaths are cool- id kill someone to start again in 2016 to avoid evolving into something like today) . I had intense anger breakouts. I physically hurt my mommy. I destroyed a door in my anger. I became such a good liar and manipulator, i know which buttons to press in people. I committed a few crimes, no severe ones. Ok one time i was one 700mcg acid and i had to call the ambulance. Because i low kicked the leg of a paramedic they had to call the police . I also got violent towards the police and eventually ended up in the icu, my arms and legs were fixed to the bed for safety reasons. I also lacked empathy. I had much darker thoughts too, but i won’t type em here. I’m honestly concerned. Im so depressed atm , but im also extremely motivated at the same time. I wanna finally date someone, sports every day, i read nearly 2 non fictions book per week. I wanna go to university. But im also depressed and if id die tonight id be actually okay with it. I want him. I don’t understand why it never happened. When i met him a few weeks ago; i thought he flirted with me. But i lack empathy and I’m insane. I would not even say im 30% sure. - sorry for my english.

recently I have been under so much stress,"I have been helping my parents out for the past couple years and I feel so pressured to continue as on of my other siblings help out nearly as much as I do. school has also just been a major contributor to stress and I feel the need to show no negative emotions infront of my family, even though they would understand. I have just been bottling it up, and every couple months just been crying for a couple hours for a night. and it feels so bad because I actually don't want to help my parents anymore because the stress levels are so God damned high. I am only a teenager. i shouldn't have to deal with this amount of stress daily. to make it worse I have a sibling who is suicidal(not actively attempting) but I try to play games with them as much as possible, even to the detriment of my school work. it has just been so hard to cope with all of this. I know bottling my emotions is not a good way to cope, but I don't have any other way I know of. I tried going on a run, that only helped during it, not after.i really need some help with this. Edit my parents also get annoyed at me for not waking up to my alarms and sometimes just strait up waking up late. I feel so much pressure. I have straight up not done math assignments because of the pressure I feel to keep everyone happy. I really love my parents. I am bot saying they are bad Parents, I have just not been open enough to them","recently I have been under so much stress I have been helping my parents out for the past couple years and I feel so pressured to continue as on of my other siblings help out nearly as much as I do. school has also just been a major contributor to stress and I feel the need to show no negative emotions infront of my family, even though they would understand. I have just been bottling it up, and every couple months just been crying for a couple hours for a night. and it feels so bad because I actually don't want to help my parents anymore because the stress levels are so God damned high. I am only a teenager. i shouldn't have to deal with this amount of stress daily. to make it worse I have a sibling who is suicidal(not actively attempting) but I try to play games with them as much as possible, even to the detriment of my school work. it has just been so hard to cope with all of this. I know bottling my emotions is not a good way to cope, but I don't have any other way I know of. I tried going on a run, that only helped during it, not after.i really need some help with this.

Should I stay?,"Please someone help me. I'm so conflicted. I've (21F) been with my boyfriend (27M) for about a year now, we've been living together for several months and have become co-dependent. I've noticed that he has some anger/emotional issues and they have been greatly affecting me. There are times where he drives recklessly, yells, gets angry at the dogs, slams things, or generally expresses his anger outwardly. He's scared me on multiple occasions, yet he is simultaneously my only source of emotional support. I was in denial about it for a long time and didn't tell anyone (not even my therapist) out of fear that they would make me break up with him or tell me to leave. He apologized for his behavior and has committed to going to therapy but I'm not sure if it's smart to get back into the relationship (as it takes time to heal/change). Each person I've talked to has given contradicting advice, although most voted to have a clean breakup. Many have pointed out the red flags and it's making me second guess a lot of the relationship (was it manipulation? Was I stuck in a submissive role?). I think it's a mix of a lot of different things... (or am I still in denial about how toxic it was?). My logic is that if he could control it, he would have stopped, meaning he needs time to work on it. Thus, it would be illogical to jump back into a relationship without giving him enough time to work on himself in therapy. My therapist recommended taking some time apart, although that can translate into many different things (distance? a break? a breakup? etc). We've spent the past couple of weeks apart on weird talking terms and I just want to figure out what I should do. I've never been more confused, hurt, and alone in my entire life. I don't know what to believe anymore. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I should still try and make it work. All advice is greatly appreciated and I'm more than happy to answer any questions (since this is a relatively short post). Thank you for listening. Sending my love to whoever is reading.","Should I stay? Please someone help me. I'm so conflicted.

Self Confidence and Self worth are not the same,"A lot of people seem genuinely surprised that I suffer from depression, because I like to joke around and I'm extremely confident in myself. What a lot of people don't get is I can be confident in my abilities while still feeling worthless. I'm very intelligent, athletic, and charming (despite my obvious cockiness lol). My problem isn't that I feel I lack those things, it's that I always feel like if I'm not the best I'm a failure. If it's for a job application, I'm sure I'm qualified but someone better qualified definitely applied, so why bother. I'm very muscular and reasonably good looking, but the girls I date are definitely used to dating sex gods, so I'm constantly fighting those shadows. When it comes to sports I know I'm decent, but I gotta be the best, so anything less than 1st hurts. Hell depending on the competition even 1st place feels empty. It sucks that people's go to advice is ""be confident in yourself"". For people lacking confidence, that's way underestimating the task. For people who are depressed but don't experience a lack of confidence, it's worthless advice.","Self Confidence and Self worth are not the same A lot of people seem genuinely surprised that I suffer from depression, because I like to joke around and I'm extremely confident in myself.

Chronic stress/anxiety and the aftermath of its related issues.,"So long story short, on the outside I have the seemingly “perfect” life 31yo female with no remarkable health issues, a thriving career making a decent living, a happy and healthy young daughter, in a long term relationship with a man who loves me (my daughters father) a beautiful home, nice car, no real financial troubles (aside from overspending/undersaving).... however, I have been dealing with major, chronic stress/anxiety for about a year now stemming mostly from my relationship (75% stepchildren related) and now my job (because I am unable to resolve this stress). I have always had anxiety issues, so I have been an evening marijuana user for approx. 8 years to wind down and help me sleep. This stress has recently turned into depression ~9 months ago when my stepdaughter was alienated from us, “because of me”. It was then I started to notice new, troubling acute and intermittent symptoms, like brain fog, poor concentration, NO libido, inability to relay thoughts consistently and effectively, extreme fatigue, no appetite, no strength, high BP/racing heart, weakness, to name a few. 4 days ago, I experienced what I believed to be a mini stroke - although I was “alert”, I felt very disoriented, couldn’t talk normally, felt confused, off balance, numbness in hands, felt like I was gliding rather than walking. After a couple of hours, I eventually went to urgent care to get my symptoms reviewed, as I simply just did not want to commit myself to ED if it was not 100% necessary (I know that wasn’t the best option in that moment, however I felt for me it was.) Neuro exam review was “fine” they said, and she said I likely had an inner ear infection, and gave me Antivert and said to follow up with PCP. Me knowing my history, I was not sold on that diagnosis, but felt fine enough to accept it. Today I followed up with my PCP whom I’ve been with for 10 years. She agreed that it likely wasnt an inner ear infection due to lack of symptoms, so I have an MRI ordered and will be going tomorrow. I actually work in the medical field, specifically mental health and addiction, so I am very well aware that my stress/anxiety/depression/MJ use are likely the reason for my issues. I am concerned about the damage my body has endured with this stroke-like incident. Has this stress simply turned my otherwise healthy body over for good? I know without a doubt all of these issues have put me where I am today. A few weeks ago (prior to the “stroke” incident), I was certain I had MS due to all my progressive symptoms, yet knowing deep down the real, most likely culprits that would need to cease before going to major diagnosis like that, but the only missing symptom was a stroke- then bam! That happens. I have not used MJ for 4 days (I’m fine without it), but the relationship and kid stress is something that will not stop or go away. Basically I’ve decided to finally move out to get away from the stress I cannot control, and I’m hoping that will save my life. Work related stress I used to handle like a champ, but now I’m falling behind at work and unable to catch up. If things keep going this way, I will eventually lose my job; or worse, my life as this constant fight or flight is slowly killing me. My mood is just emotionless. At this point, I’m simply in survival mode which has essentially ruined/ended my relationship. I realize I must make some major lifestyle changes, I am just hoping to hear that these issues are resolvable assuming I make the right decisions. I also am well aware that chronic MJ use plays the biggest part in my mental health conditions, however I had used that to cope with them, up until now when I physically just cannot do that anymore. Anyone have anything to say? Not even sure what I’m looking for here, other than someone who has experienced this and understands what I’m going through.","Chronic stress/anxiety and the aftermath of its related issues.

Today was my 21st birthday,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days) one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. EDIT The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough thank you, thank you, thank you. ","Today was my 21st birthday I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country.

There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. EDIT The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough thank you, thank you, thank you. ",1
I want to die but I don't want to die.,"Can anyone else relate to this? Every day plays out the same way. Bored out of my mind, extremely unmotivated to do anything. I'm sure that if I keep going forward, I may reach something that may make me happy eventually. But that would take so much work, way too much for me. How could someone like me achieve something so big, when I get tired just from performing tasks required to live? I am almost tired 24/7. Wake up, get out of bed, eat food, maybe take a shower. Ok, I've had enough for the day already. I've already realized that in the end, anything that I accomplish in life won't mean anything. When I die, everything that I did in my life won't matter anymore. It might matter to the people that were entangled in my timeline, but eventually they will figure out the same thing, so it's fine, they will stop caring as well. Wherever darkness manifests itself, there is still light. I still want to enjoy my life here on earth, and in fact, I do sometimes. I still really care about the people close to me. The feeling of love is what stops me from ending it. I wish that I didn't have to feel this way, but I'm still a human. It pains me that some people care about me, because they really shouldn't. If they knew how I felt, I'm sure it would pain them. I wish others didn't need to feel pain. I know that this is definitely not normal, but sometimes I feel that my goal is to save everyone from this inevitable suffering. I doubt it will happen, but some day I think that I would like to build some crazy powerful atomic bomb and destroy earth so us humans would no longer have to feel anything anymore. I want to die, but I don't want to die yet.","I want to die but I don't want to die. Can anyone else relate to this? Every day plays out the same way.

What emergency stress relief strategies/remedies do you use?,"I had my first attempt at a driving test last week. I didn’t just mess up the parallel parking at the beginning; I messed up a lot of dumb things on my way back to the DPS parking lot. This past weekend I had my graduation. My anxiety over taking good pics turned me into a “grad-zilla” squinting_face_with_tongue . I already take meds that help a lot with keeping my anxiety controlled. I’ve been inconsistent with exercise and meditation but I’m sure I’ll get that figured out someday lol. My main question is what can I do for immediate relief when I feel the stress building on my body? I’m nervous that when I take the driving test again a week from now, the anxiety will kill me again. I’d appreciate any and all advice on this. Thanks","What emergency stress relief strategies/remedies do you use? I had my first attempt at a driving test last week.

Does anyone weirdly find comfort in their depression?,"When I feel ok, I feel off. When I sink into a depressive mindset, in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied.

My therapist committed suicide,"Last week my long time therapist committed suicide and I don’t know how to cope. I feel so alone. This wasn’t just some therapist off the street, he was highly educated, well respected, and worked with a few institutions. Selfishly, I feel hurt and abandoned. Everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like “a close friend died, get a new friend” but so much trust was broken. I don’t want to open up to a new therapist. The thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do I have?” And also, selfishly, “how could he?” I know mental health is a beast and I know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair. Like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed. Thanks for listening. ","My therapist committed suicide Last week my long time therapist committed suicide and I don’t know how to cope.

The time I spend was work or study and it just was all too much for me. End 2020 I got in contact again with an old colleague (21M). And well, since new years eve we’re officially together. We really had the honeymoon phase and we grew out of it, which was a pretty hard time. He went a little too far with a girl friend he hadn’t seen in a while at a party. So it wasn’t really a very hard time, but mostly emotionally draining and I was just tired of everything. But when I knew what kind of study I wanted to try next year, things suddenly got better. I’m going to study to become a math teacher. And in the country where I’m from, there is an enormous shortage of teachers. So I thought, why not send an open application to my old high school.

It isn’t really common here to move out when you are 18. My dad has a small rental house in his backyard (the literal translation for it is a “summerhouse” or as we call it a “zomerhuis”). And the girl who lives there, is moving. So me and my boyfriend are going to move in end of this month!!! We are renovating right now. And I just really wanted to share. My life really couldn’t have been any better. Great school, my dream job, my dream man and a house!",0
My 11yo Daughter Just Tried To Interview Me,"My 11yo daughter has to do a ""biography"" on a family member as an assignment for school. I'm the only one around so she tried to interview me. One of the first questions *""What's something good you have done in your life?"".* I know this illness clouds your mind, but there was literally nothing I could tell her to give her an answer to this question. She didn't have any other questions, so we left it at that. How tf can I possibly give an answer to that question when I feel like such a failure? I hate that now I am even more a failure and disappointment in her eyes.","My 11yo Daughter Just Tried To Interview Me My 11yo daughter has to do a ""biography"" on a family member as an assignment for school.

Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever,"I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly. I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will. I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me. And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them. But, it helped so much. Honestly. Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care. To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life. I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone. She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen. She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice. Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge. Probably wasn’t going to go through with it, but I really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and I couldn’t stand up anymore. Thank you stranger. Now I’m gonna go binge movies and work.","Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and..,"I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger.

That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. Edit I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others.

Traditionally, I used to get sad as a teenager over things but as I got old it just became anger. Which I handled okay because I use to go running. Then my facial hair started falling out and all of a sudden I am feeling a lot more sad than angry. I just feel like the world is put to get me and things aren't going right for me. I feel like someone put a curse on me. Things were going well and now everything is just going awful.

This Year has been a Sh*tShow,"Where to begin. 1. Found out a ""friend"" has been backstabbing me (which i already sorta knew) 2. Had a(n ex) coworker threaten his life and the wellbeing of others (while he is gone now, the stress of him randomly showing up still lurks) 3. Rough 8 months of a relationship, with a guy I really love; he is struggling with his life, and it has affected my life (we are working on it and the past month has been okay, but the stress of the last 8 still linger). 4. Guilted into a family vacation I didn't want; I had fun, but everything before and after was just hell. 5. My cat has been on and off sick all year, and it is destroying me financially. 6. I have been led on by a corporation for a ""real job"", only to not get it (I had three interviews, they suggested I had the job, and then they didn't even bother to call me \[i called them!\] to tell me I didn't get it) 7. Got rejected from a ""real job"" because I had a Master's (remember that lie we grew up with? Degrees get jobs? BS) 8. Political and environmental shit has been staying up at night 9. Had a friend block me on everything because we had different opinions on how the police issue in AMerica should be handled; she wouldn't even talk it out with me. Now I'm a ""horrible person"" even though she didn't get the full side of my opinion. 10. My mom revealed she is going to cheat on my step-dad. I cut her out of my life, cuz I'm sick of her self-sabotaging and insensitive bs; she is making me pay, literally, by demanding money I owe her from something she gifted me months ago. She doesn't even need the money; she's rich. She is doing it out of spite, and sending me harassing mail. 11. My car was broken into last night. 12. Got into a fight with a friend about her ignorance on the topic of mental health; it's not like I have a degree in it or anything.... oh wait. I do. Things have been awkward in the friend group for the last few months because of it. 13. Had family members lose their homes due to tornadoes I honestly am not okay. My mental emotional health has been terrible this year. Yes, I am getting help. NO, it isn't working. I don't see the point in staying in a world that's basically falling apart.","This Year has been a Sh*tShow Where to begin. 1.

Had a(n ex) coworker threaten his life and the wellbeing of others (while he is gone now, the stress of him randomly showing up still lurks) 3. Rough 8 months of a relationship, with a guy I really love; he is struggling with his life, and it has affected my life (we are working on it and the past month has been okay, but the stress of the last 8 still linger). 4. Guilted into a family vacation I didn't want; I had fun, but everything before and after was just hell. 5. My cat has been on and off sick all year, and it is destroying me financially. 6. I have been led on by a corporation for a ""real job"", only to not get it (I had three interviews, they suggested I had the job, and then they didn't even bother to call me \[i called them!\] to tell me I didn't get it) 7. Got rejected from a ""real job"" because I had a Master's (remember that lie we grew up with? Degrees get jobs? BS) 8. Political and environmental shit has been staying up at night 9. Had a friend block me on everything because we had different opinions on how the police issue in AMerica should be handled; she wouldn't even talk it out with me. Now I'm a ""horrible person"" even though she didn't get the full side of my opinion. 10. My mom revealed she is going to cheat on my step-dad. I cut her out of my life, cuz I'm sick of her self-sabotaging and insensitive bs; she is making me pay, literally, by demanding money I owe her from something she gifted me months ago. She doesn't even need the money; she's rich. She is doing it out of spite, and sending me harassing mail. 11. My car was broken into last night. 12. Got into a fight with a friend about her ignorance on the topic of mental health; it's not like I have a degree in it or anything.... oh wait. I do. Things have been awkward in the friend group for the last few months because of it. 13. Had family members lose their homes due to tornadoes I honestly am not okay. My mental emotional health has been terrible this year. Yes, I am getting help. NO, it isn't working. I don't see the point in staying in a world that's basically falling apart.",1

Decisions,"I made a last minute decision to apply for summer school but I didn’t realize that one strict rule they have is that I can only miss ONE day of school which is very very inconvenient for me because my parents already booked a week long vacation. I’ve been trying to convince them to let me miss a week, and that I’ll make up all the work but they keep saying they can’t give me an answer yet. My parents told me to just quit because this class isn’t even mandatory and will just add more stress to me. Now I’m emailing the teachers for a millionth time except this time I’m asking them to remove me from the classes. None of them have responded and I’m just so so so stressed because I feel like I’ve made a bad impression on them and I don’t know what to do.

Screen Time Negatives,"I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions. Demand People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer. Distance You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have. Curating Interactions Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers. Intentional “On Read” There can be an effect to silence. Sometimes silence speaks. Think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking... When we can use the screens between us to ignore someone, to be silent, sometimes that’s louder than outright hostility. Concluding my list as I write this at 00 38, I was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep. No luck. The contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought, I immediately reached for my phone.

Can't afford university,"University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed). I called them and told them it was bullshit and they said I need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency (from when I was a baby). This seems incredibly illogical because I was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved. The only difference now is that my passport is renewed. The student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university (which is when the fees are due). I am now forced to pay out of pocket, which I can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account. Furthermore, if my student loan doesn't get processed in time for the second semester, I'm forced to drop out and work. Which seems very likely if THIS is a hiccup in their system. I know things could be worse but I am incredibly annoyed at how the company that offers the student loan service simply looked at the renewal date of my passport and declined. I would assume there are other ways to confirm how long I've held a permanent residency status other than a renewal date. Thanks to anyone reading this far.","Can't afford university University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed).

How to survive Christmas?!,"Sorry in advance for any mistakes, English is not my first language! For as long as I can remember Christmas has always been a time of very intense feelings for me. I've always felt the Christmas holidays to be an overwhelming and stressful period of time, basically the exact opposite of what holidays are supposed to be like. My parents also reinforced this by making the Christmas stuff last for days. By this I do not only mean the actual celebration, but also the seemingly endless time you have to spend with the same people over and over again, including the same old political arguments and the forced gatherings of relatives you literally NEVER (have to) see except for this time of the year. Even without all this family stress, Christmas itself, the beginning of a new year and also my birthday (also happening at the beginning of January) are times, when I feel low no matter what happens. I always feel like I haven't even nearly accomplished as much as I'd like in my life and I've never even once in my life felt as happy as you probably should feel for Christmas or your birthday. I feel like there's this mutual agreement all over the world, that this is the time of the year, the time of your life and simply the time, where you should feel best and some magic miracles happen and your life upgrades itself to next level. (I know it's unrealistic and probably an unhealthy way of thinking, but it seems like subconsciously this thought is stuck with me.) This whole thing stresses me out intensely every year, but this year it's especially bad or maybe it's been that bad the years before and I just pushed it out of my mind. The point is, it's gotten to me physically and I've had a cold for basically a month now and the last few days, my back's been extremely stiff and sore, which is something that usually never happens. I'm panicking intensely even thinking about going home to my parents' place for Christmas next week and I don't know to get through these days/weeks, without feeling like I'll go insane any minute. I hope this is the right sub for this problem and I appreciate you reading this far and if you have any tips for making Christmas a bit easier even better )","How to survive Christmas?!

But I don’t feel high functioning at all. I feel like I’m actually just barely functioning. I’m just doing enough to appear alright to others, but nothing else extra. I just don’t think high functioning is the right label for most “high functioning” people.","High functioning depression is really just barely functioning Depressed people who can manage to do the bare minimum (shower enough to not be noticeably unhygienic, show up to work, fake being alright while socializing) are labeled as high functioning.

I quit my gas station job on the spot,"Hi everyone I was working on a gas station during the summer and I just wanted to tell someone my frustrations. My employer knew I had plans to return to school this 6th of june. I provided my school schedule so she was able to see I am being truthful. I did this a month in advance and I help her to get a replacement for the other 20 hours I wasn't going to work. The week I return to school she didn't change my schedule and i confronted her and she said that she can't change the schedule. I was understanding and I suck it up and fuck my sleep because I knew she was having a hard time. I just tell her that next week I better get my schedule right and she said that I am good employee and wanted to make me assistant manager because everyone in this place have the IQ of someone who is brain damage. Therefore, she went on telling me that she didn't want me to quit. Guess what she fuck my schedule I was pretty clear no more than 20 hours ( two 10 hours shift thats how we did it) And to top it all I worked 11 00 PM- 7 00AM (Graveyard shift) and she wanted me to come back at 3 00 PM. It would have been miserable but nothing crazy but also I had class at 9 30- 12 30. I wasn't able to take it anymore she got to the store I ask her if she knew I had to go to school and I would not be able to sleep and go to work. She only said ""oh I am sorry this girl cannot cover you because she can't (background she is referring to a girl that doesn't go to school, no kids, doesn't work full time because she has to be supervised because she is kinda dump and always come short on the register) I clock off and leave a text message that I won't come back.","I quit my gas station job on the spot Hi everyone I was working on a gas station during the summer and I just wanted to tell someone my frustrations.

Whining about my past and current state,"I really don't know what to write, but I somehow have to get this off my chest. Might be a bit of rambling, but I've got nobody to actually talk to (also sorry for some mistakes, german fellow here) Okay, so a little background story. Basically since I'm 12/13 (I'm 22 now) I'm suffering from mental problems, mostly depression. At a time it was also severe social anxiety. I've been in a hospital for it for around 2 months. I got into it because I admitted to contemplating suicide. But basically after getting out it didn't really get better. Why all of that? Well... My parents divorced at a young age. My back then stepdad was an asshole. Nothing was more important to him than his house, car and work. He's my little brothers dad and I guess I don't need to tell you that my big brother and I weren't of big interest for him. We had this big ass house, but nothing was getting done. He was never home, me and my brother went to school, my little brother was a baby, my mom was also working and I had to see her burning out more and more. Then she divorced him after getting back the strength and I got sucked into a lawsuit. He took my little brother and didn't bring him back. So... court appointments, youth welfare office, appraisers... All being at home, wanting to speak to me as well (my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids)... If this wasn't enough. My big brother and I also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me. But my dad also is someone who's suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe I learned from it upside-down_face However... School was never better. I was basically always bullied. Can't remember a time in school this wasn't the case until the last year. And that's it. I got to know a beautiful girl. Apparently I caught her eye and she reached out to me... Three years of a almost perfect relationship. Before that I only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me... It really was a long time I haven't been that happy. She was beautiful, she was smart, funny and so on... But in the end she left me for another dude. This was two years ago and I'm still suffering from it. Not that I want back. I just... Can't start anything new. So let's add ""trust issues"" to the list. But that's not just because of this. After it I tried dating other people. But in the end it was them fucking others while being with me, trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that. I kinda got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls I found on Grindr or Tinder (also I never got to out me and I really regret that). But that was a big problem, because I realized how superficial a lot of people are. I wouldn't say I'm ugly... I'm really not. Actually from most people I get compliments. ""You are so beautiful"". Or the best friend of my ex said ""everytime you see Toni he's getting hotter"". I started working out, lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and I had to stop. It got me into a spiral again I can't get out. I hate my body again, I gained weight, I hate looking in the mirror in general. I just don't like what I see. Now I wanted to start training again, but of course I fell while biking and now my hand hurts... It's like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like ""you thought haha"". What about friends you ask? Never really had them. I met some really cool people when I was with my girlfriend. I thought. When she broke up they all told me ""Toni we want this friendships to last, don't worry"", just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months. Even after I reached out multiple times. And now? Well I wanted to start over again. Moved from my hometown to a new City, got into university. ""New City, New opportunities, New friends"". Well. Covid was like ""nope"" (everything was online), it seems like I'm too dumb for what I'm doing, I'm still only sitting at home, wasted another summer and... I just wonder... Will it ever stop? Will it ever get better? Slowly I'm thinking it will never get better. That every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything I've built up so far. ""You got money? Well here's you're washing machine broken! Finally got a person you like? Well they fuck someone else! Finally took the step to a better life? Well I'll do everything that it will be the same in the end! Finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym? Well gyms are closed now! Lost 10kg of weight? Well you'll hate yourself either way, don't you? Gyms are open again? Well, fucking fall while biking, hurt your hand and and damage your bike so you can't even bike anymore, because you've got no money to repair it! And let's face it... You need money for a new PC first, because yours is broken and you need one for university, you need new clothes, at least a jacket for when it gets colder!"". I really can't do this anymore. Maybe I'm just whiny... I don't know. But in the end that's just a small insight into my life. I'm 22 now and I'm at that point again I wonder if it even makes sense anymore. Especially when the current state of the world is not getting better either. And the worst thing is... Compared to others, looking at what I've reached yet (at least looking at my apartment). I feel horrible, because I should probably feel good about myself, because I've got it better. I've invested a lot of money into it and I'm really happy with how it turned out. Others would dream of that at that age... Maybe I just can't get enough? I really don't know... Thanks for reading tho. Don't know if anyone got some advice or ideas what I can do.

I’m so embarrassed I can’t envision a future for myself that’s it’s affecting my relationships,"I’m envious of everyone around me. Even envious of the old me. I used to have goals and aspirations. Now all I do is sleep. I used to be smart, bright, had so much to say about the world and would easily slip into witty banter with my friends. Now I’m slow, everything I say feels scripted, every movement I make feels stiff, everything I do feels fake. I feel like an imposter. I got accepted to great colleges, attended one and ended up flunking three semester due to this void inside me. I was so embarrassed of the shell of a human I had become, hollow, purposeless, no goals, just empty. Even though I’m seemingly “much better” I’m still the same. Even when things are good, this void never leaves. When it gets quiet inside me, that void grows. I don’t know if I can continue living like this. I just want to feel normal. I’m talking to this guy I really like but he’s so motivated with such a bright future ahead of him, and he likely thinks the same of me based on what I told him, but those things I said aren’t me at all. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I’m constantly questioning how I’m going to survive if everything keeps getting heavier and I keep getting tired and nothing has meaning anymore. I want to smile genuinely. I want to feel that spark of interest. Nothing. I don’t see anything and I’m jealous of my brother and my cousin.

I’m worried I’m losing touch with reality,"Hi, I’m under a lot of family and social stress, and I’m freaking out because I think I’m starting to lose it. I keep hearing things that I’m not sure are really there, like incoherent whispering, humming, creaking or breathing. I have really vivid, disturbing hallucinations while I’m on the verge of sleep that make me afraid to go to bed at night, the slightest sound panicking me. I’m an excessive daydreamer (not something I want to get rid of) which means I’m constantly in my own head, but it’s becoming harder and harder to control my thoughts. Sometimes I’ll become so entrenched in a mental argument I’ll be motionless for up to half an hour at a time, sometimes to the point of tears. I’ve tried all that ‘mindfulness’ stuff and it doesn’t help me whatsoever, if anything it only stresses me out more. I’m scared to seek help because I don’t want to be seen as “just another attention seeking teenager,” and have already been dismissed by my mother when I shared my concerns. My dad has depression himself and I don’t want to stress him out any more. There’s nobody else I’m particularly close to. At this exact moment I’m the only one still awake at my house and every little sound around me is freaking me out. I’ve had a strange feeling building up for weeks, I can only compare it to the feeling you have when you’re dreaming and only a part of you knows it. Of course I know this is reality, but that feeling won’t go away.","I’m worried I’m losing touch with reality Hi, I’m under a lot of family and social stress, and I’m freaking out because I think I’m starting to lose it.

But even after submitting them I just feel weird. I literally can’t sleep and I have this weird hyper feeling and strange sensation in my chest and like this cold feeling in my heart. I’ve also had a few headaches today. Also I feel like my emotions are gone (happy/sad). I just feel really weird. I also can’t visualise things as well as I used to. I also have the odd bit of heart pain.,Is this stress? So I know why I’ve been feeling weird and everything is because I had like two assignments to do for this week and I’ve finally submitted them.

Can't keep doing this (venting),"I've always been depressed to some degree since I was very young. I knew there was something wrong with my brain, but whenever I tried to ask my parents for help or to see someone about it, they would brush it off. Now though, years and years later, I do see a psychiatrist and I'm in therapy, but I hit an excruciating swing of depression for the past few weeks. I can't stop thinking about how much I've screwed up my life, how many people I've disappointed, how the things I've done and been through are impossible to come back from. I've lost weight at an extreme speed because I can't gather the motivation to go make myself something to feed myself, or really the motivation to do anything. I think about death a lot. How it could just end this whole cycle. Every minute just drags on and it's messing with my perception of time. And I'm just so TIRED of sleeping, not wanting to do anything but sleep, but then feeling like a failure for not getting anything done. I have a couple friends who check up on me, but I feel like I don't deserve them. I don't wanna bring their mood down, it doesn't feel like I'm being a good friend back. And I just really can't keep doing this, can't keep waking up feeling exactly the same or worse from the day before. I don't know how much longer I can take it.","Can't keep doing this (venting) I've always been depressed to some degree since I was very young.

Meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life. You really never know what's going on with someone. This is a reminder to just be kind when you can because you don't know what's happening under the surface.,"I was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation I had with a fellow student back in 7th grade. I was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves. He's got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them. He just casually tells us he has a cutting problem. His parents had to confiscate knives and things. The rest of the group kind of just was like, ""OK wow that's scary"" and then we just did the assignment. I feel like I missed an opportunity there to help someone out. This guy just opened up about something so personal, and I sort of just was shocked and confused so I didn't comfort him and I didn't say anything touching or kind back. Honestly, I think I just couldn't process it. Was he joking? For me at least, lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school. It had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way. When I think back on the whole interaction, I realize I would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if I didn't just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves. I'm also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group, including myself. Another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school. I feel like that's so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now. The main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through. I would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that. He was so smart (I kind of was jealous at times) and he made the wittiest jokes 24/7 and he was always smiling. I don't know what has happened to him. I think he switched schools the next year or moved or something. Wherever he is, I hope he's doing well and I hope he's found some real support since our school didn't provide it.","Meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life.

Why I hate watching scary movies.,"I watched the movie Midsomer and I have not been able to get it out of my head. I hate watching scary movies but in the past I would get over them in about a day or so because the things in them were fake. Things like ware wolves, ghosts, vampires, immortal men running around killing people and other things that don’t exist. But Midsomer...? It’s a story that’s plausible. If you don’t know what it is, it’s about a cult. And it’s fucked up. That movie, I have not been able to get over and it’s been 4 days. It’s giving me anxiety. I keep thinking morbid things will happen to me or the people around me. I havnt been able to sleep with my door open or the lights off, my boyfriend has had to stay the night every night because otherwise I can’t sleep. I’m 23 years old and I work in an ER where I see actual injuries and people actually die and that doesn’t keep me up at night. But that movie has screwed with my head. I hate watching scary movies and I only watch them with my family once a year, which is around Halloween. My family states that my “immunity” does not exist in the month of October. I know this is page is about stress but that movie has given me so much anxiety that I feel stressed. I havnt drank soda in four days because my heart feels like it’s racing all the time and I know caffeine and sugar will only make it worse. Not sure what to do to get over this. I’ve never been affected by a movie this way before.","Why I hate watching scary movies. I watched the movie Midsomer and I have not been able to get it out of my head.

Just a Sea of Darkness,"I try so hard to see the positive things. I try to focus on the sunlight and flowers or yummy food. But lately? The sunlight just burns, the flowers are wilting, and nothing tastes good. Everything is cardboard to a depressed soul. I stopped my medication for several reasons so I knew it would come back hard. But on top of that, I've had to live in a greasy motel for a month with my husband, daughter, and two cats. Then move into our house which has cost us thousands. Then get ready to send my 2 year old to daycare for the first time while I go back to school. Right after finding out my husband is deploying for a year. I'm used to being a single mom at this point. He's always gone. But he's prioritizing his coworkers over his family right before he leaves. And he knows my depression is horrible. But he's only unkind to me. Angry. Unsympathetic. What hurts the most is that last night, someone struggling with depression called him and he talked to them for hours to help them through it. But me? Me he shoves to the wayside with little concern. He brushes me off as selfish, overdramatic, and more. I don't have anyone to call. I don't have anyone to talk me through it. Nobody cares enough, no matter how much I struggle. So I struggle through it silently and alone. And every day I wonder if it will be the day I finally break. I've endured so much pain. Sadness. Loss. Trauma. Abuse. I don't know why I've kept going. But lately, every day seems meaningless. I'm just numb, going through the motions of being a responsible and level-headed adult. All the while I'm spinning out internally and I have nobody to turn to. Loneliness is my only friend.","Just a Sea of Darkness I try so hard to see the positive things.

Hate the idea of doing any work...,"Am I only one that feels this way? Along with all the symptoms of depression, the one that I find the least common is the lack of willingness and ability to do anything. I hate it when I know I have uni work, I hate it when I have to do with the family somewhere, I hate it when I have to iron clothes, I can’t study, I can never do my laundry in time, etc It’s not coming from a standpoint of, “oh I preferrr not to do workkkk today”. Just work in general is painful to me. It can ruin my day just hearing that I have any task to complete. Many depressed people are still having fun going to work, doing chores, etc. But it feels like death to me.","Hate the idea of doing any work... Am I only one that feels this way?

My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks. She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total. After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start? Just needed to rant and vent a little.

How do I come back from a joke gone poorly?,"I’m too lazy to make an alt acc or whatever. Last night I went to dinner with some of my coworkers who I was becoming pretty good friends with. I’ll say this now, I was a little under the influence. Over the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with financial struggles, the passing of my grandpa, who was my last grandparent alive, and not being able to leave my house and go hang with other people. Back to last night, things were going okay and we were all having fun, I think. My one pal and I always crack, I guess you could say, “edgy” jokes. He was like “Oh yeah btw guys, (me) is a violently racist person.” It took me a good 30-45 seconds to realize what he said and all my friends were like “(me) what the fuck dude, are not gonna say anything?” I tried to explain that I infact wasn’t and that it was a joke, but it was too late. About 5 min later we were still cracking jokes and we were talking about our newest coworker (she wasn’t with us). My edgy friend asked what ethnicity she was and I said she was African American, because I genuinely thought she was, even though I’ve only interacted with her like 3 times. My very liberal manager got up and said “dude are you fucking retarded?” She had never said something like this to me before so I was caught off guard. My mind was scrambling and I was thinking, “Ok, what is she then? She has to be one of the other ones [ethnicities]” Well my stupid monkey brain said “Oh one of the other ones” out loud and everyone just looked at me. At this moment I knew I was fucked and there was no way of helping myself. Over the next couple hours most of them didn’t really talk to me at all and I could tell that they were genuinely disappointed in me and I felt all of this guilt engulf me. I sent a long message in our group text and only one of them responded saying “yeah man, the stuff you said rubbed us the wrong way and we are not the audience for that.” After that they have yet to talk to me and I have to go work later and I can’t get myself to cheer up at all. Do you guys have any advice. TL;DR I made a ignorant and slightly racist comment while under the influence at dinner with my coworkers and they are very angry at me and aren’t responding to my apologies.","How do I come back from a joke gone poorly?

Does anyone else feel like their life is boring as hell and not worth living for?,I don't even really have friends and every day is always filled with constant stress due to schoolwork. And I've been called ugly lots of times so my self-esteem is basically in the negatives and I've never gotten a compliment before. And it really sucks seeing all these people your own age having fun with friends/girlfriends being happy. I've always felt like this since forever and there's not even a light at the end of the tunnel. I got college to stress about and I'll be having to get a job soon and get a driver's test. Most of the time I just wish something cool could just happen to me but the reality is that nothing is ever gonna happen since that's the truth. Honestly wish I had an accessible way to off myself without getting run over by a truck or something painful like that.,Does anyone else feel like their life is boring as hell and not worth living for? I don't even really have friends and every day is always filled with constant stress due to schoolwork. And I've been called ugly lots of times so my self-esteem is basically in the negatives and I've never gotten a compliment before.

I feel like I'm at the end. I don't have the motivation to get better and it's like I'm putting on this big act thats starting to fail.,"I did what you're supposed to. Now I'm at a loss. I stopped being so hard on myself, I started college, I tried to be more active in my life. But these feelings keep coming back. I will never be taken serious. I feel so unworthy of being loved and cared for. But at the same time I crave it so much. I can't stop being mean to the ones I love, I feel so exhausted and emotionally drained and can feel myself acting shitty and taking my feelings out on others and i feel so horrible afterwards. I feel so lonely and i want to self harm so much. I've caved a few times this week unfortunately after a long period of not doing it. I just don't know how to better myself and not end up back in the same position I'm in now.","I feel like I'm at the end.

I have school tomorrow and I’m so fucking tired,"I know this sounds like some edgy fake shitmix some fourteen year old has conjured up for the sake of attention but I’m just so tired. I’ve struggled with my mental health for the past year and a half now. My thighs always have some sort of fresh cuts on them, I feel like lead and I can’t seem to hold onto the small rays of happiness even if I wanted to. And school is just….so intimidating. I told everyone I’d get up and make lunches for my sister and I, because since cooking is something I like I thought taking that initiative would help me get up in the mornings. But now the aspect of everything going wrong and being too swamped with work makes my head heart and I feel like my hearts about to burst because even this small thing that could’ve been a reprieve from the cold dark and unmotivated pit I was in will just slip from my fingers like everything else. I don’t know how to be a teenager who’s dealing with mental health and being around people who have no idea what it actually is like. I know I sound like I’m putting on some kind of noble, “woe is me” kind of attitude by saying this because I’m so “edgy” and “quirky” and for what? For wanting to rip my guts out? For saving money for my funeral? For not being able to wash myself or keep up basic hygiene because it takes so much fucking effort? And I’m so tired of hearing the adults who’ve had nothing but success call suicidal people the scum of the earth, or my father and mother, (if I have to call them that) screaming at me for yet another flaw I didn’t notice existed until they pointed it out. Or the emo dipshits","I have school tomorrow and I’m so fucking tired I know this sounds like some edgy fake shitmix some fourteen year old has conjured up for the sake of attention but I’m just so tired.

Just annoys the hell out of me and makes me instantly dislike the person, that's all rant over.","You're so quiet"" is the biggest annoyance ever and makes me want to flip my shit As a quiet person who's dealt with many mental health issues, and is generally stuck inside my own head, I enjoy being quiet, observing a lot, and not being a socially obnoxious twat who feels the need to speak just because.

So I bought myself flowers today.,"No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch. EDIT Wow ) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!! And to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. It was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today )","So I bought myself flowers today. No special occasion.

How do I target the physical symptoms of stress?,"I know for a fact these are stress based problems. I've had eczema, hives, acne, IBS, grey hair, migraines, and sleep disturbances due to my stress.

Relationship stress?,"F/20) Hello. I’ve been in my current relationship for approximately 5 months and it’s weird. I don’t find any aspect of the relationship bad or unhealthy, except that I’m quite over invested in it and I don’t know how not to be because investing emotionally and mentally into that person is important for me. But it’s made me a very stressed out person. To the extent that it has impacted my health (periods, skin, etc.) and I’m not sure how to deal with it. Naturally, other parts of my life contribute. Things like academics and work, but those are things I have no option but to cope with. My relationship is a choice and often times, amid the stress, I wonder if it’s the right choice in this very moment in time. Any advice is appreciated.","Relationship stress? F/20) Hello.

Is not sure what's happening,"So I'm not really here to use this as a diagnosis. This is more so for me to see if this is genuine enough to seek help, or just to generally get an idea of what's wrong. Im not sure that it can be classified as depression, but i didn't really know where else to go. Sometimes I really worry alot that maybe I'm subconsciously doing this for attention or something like that, or im just being dramatic and not knowing it. To start off though, whenever I'm feeling fine im a pretty motivated person. I really like to work out and box, its one fo my favorite things to do. I'm in college and I get pretty good grades, I love to explore and try new things. I'm a big foodie, maybe even to the point I eat way more than I should haha. However, I have periods of time where I just feel very very unhappy and unsatisfied with everything. I can usually tell when it's about to start. It begins with me kind of zoning out alot more and I'll start to have times where I question existence and everything seems kinda fake. These times kind of suck because I start to feel like everything I'm doing is pointless and I just want to drop out and leave. Then I start to get extremepy irritable. Im pretty much mad at everything and I'll even make stupid arguments with my gf and look for reasons to be angry. This is then followed by a period where im just unhappy I guess. I'm not sure if thats the right word. I'm not necessarily sad all the time, although I'm much more likely to be sad. But its mostly just I don't want to exist I guess. Like its so hard to just do anything and it kind of puts a strain on my relationship because I don't want to talk, or go anywhere, or even cuddle with my girlfriend. Everything I try to do is just unsatisfying, I can't even sit on tik tok or play games. I just want to do absolutely nothing and be alone, and it makes me genuinely so sad when my girlfriend wants me to get out of bed. During good periods the unhappiness will only last a few days. During bad times it can last a week or two. The zoning out and irritability will usually start 1-3 weeks before, depending on how bad it is. Its all a slow build up then it slowly goes away. This all happens kind of randomly. Maybe once every other month during the summer. It gets much worse during the winter. It lasts longer and is much more intense. I really just want to know if this is genuine or not. I'm really unsure sometimes.","Is not sure what's happening So I'm not really here to use this as a diagnosis.

As much in pain as I am right now I am so grateful. Because until now I was missing a huge understanding of my condition. A doctor once told me I was ""living in a dark room."" Well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps, and possible permanent loss of function, that go along with this disease. So I hope you have had ""a-ha"" moments about your condition too. So that we can all be on the way to recovery, like some have fortunately accomplished. ",1

Feeling like the idiot of the workplace,"Lately theses been so much issues. I wrote a really poor application for a customer, I’m behind on my learning modules and most recently I didn’t send an important email (more accurately I thought I sent it but it got saved into draft instead). Because of all of these my team covered me and I really want to explain myself but it feels/sounds like I’m just making excuses. I know I should just move on but I’m causing more work for others and can’t help but to feel shit. I’m so tired of making careless mistakes but I feel like everything is snowballing and by the time I realise it’s already too late.","Feeling like the idiot of the workplace Lately theses been so much issues.

Sometimes I wonder why I try...,"This'll probably be a little different from the usual posts here. But the result is the same. I just find myself wondering why I fight at this point. I feel like I'm surrounded by idiots. That sounds conceited, but I don't care anymore. I try to reach a common viewpoint, understand theirs, and them understand mine. But, in the end, it's pointless. You know, I argued with a guy today who told me capitalism is bad because, under capitalism, the people are exploited by businesses. He has, prior to this, told me how he does not pay bus fair because no one enforces it. I brought this up to him, and he of course simply ignored it. Meanwhile, I feel like, socially, I'm just spinning my wheels. I feel like I'm never truly improving. I'm 26 and still have yet to really experience any kind of romantic relationship. I'm more inclined to talk about myself, not out of narcissism necessarily, but rather because it's all I can think to do to relate to people. I'm a bit full of myself, but I've earned that. I'm smart, and I save lives. I do it as a volunteer, and I'll be further saving lives in Nursing. To that end, I'm surrounded by idiots at college. Not the normal idiots. the professors. I had a stat professor once give me the wrong explanation of probability fractions. He said that, to find the probability of at least 1, I'd use the formula 1-P1 (1 minus the probability of 1). This is wrong. I brought this to another professor of stat. She gave me the write answer. This man proceeded to explain to me, in depth on the opposite side of this index card with the right answer, why that was wrong. During the test, the answers were right, but another question we all got right, but were graded as getting it wrong. We spent 30 minutes arguing for the right grade. All this frustration, and I fail out of nursing program on the second to last semester. The dean was teaching, though someone else was lecturing. The dean, however, wrote the tests. I'm 26 now. I know given the time of day, I'd pass with flying colors and make an excellent nurse. However, I'm now having to finish this and restart. Of course, who cares. Anyone I tell that to will just tell me I'm not for the job. Never mind I discuss what I learned with doctors and Nurses. I know my shit, not all of it, but rather than teach, they just blindly follow policy. It is what it is. You can't fight the system, so adapt. That's always been how I operate, but, at this point, I wonder why I even bother. I LOVED my time in the hospital for clinicals, and I want nothing more than to continue to work there. But why fight to go back. What's the point of living a life where I am always fighting uphill for the bits of joy I can get. I can't connect with anyone, and when I do, they ultimately stop talking to me. Even worse, when someone is around, I constantly think that I'm just blind to how annoyed they are by me. I'm stuck between thinking I'm smart, and thinking I'm an immature dolt. I've spent years trying to work through all this, but, I'm left wondering what it's all for. What's the payoff? Will there even be a payoff? I keep thinking if I work hard enough, the enjoyable parts will begin to outnumber the miserable ones. Don't get me wrong, there are days that are fun, and those are great, but it seems like I have to fight to get to them, only to get knocked back. Is this all life is? Does it ever get to a point where I can enjoy more than I loathe? I probably feel this way because I'm depressed. It's not 24/7, but I understand there's some kind of depression colloquially called ""walking depression."" Who knows. I won't get diagnosed. I don't need a doctor to sit here and tell me what I already know. He/She will outline treatment. Of course SSRIs, tricyclics, MOAIs. Hell, I'd probably feel better. But I can do this on my own. I've made it this far. I just wish I could get assurance that I'm not wasting my time. If this is as good as it gets, I might as well kill myself now. I could at least die remotely happy knowing every weekend has been a new adventure, I died in my prime, and I didn't spend decades fighting for an unattainable goal.","Sometimes I wonder why I try...

I feel like I have no friends,"There’s a long backstory to part of my feelings around this topic, but the basics are that I have a twin and we’ve always shared everything, including friends; nearing the end of high school they got really annoyed with this and told me all our friends weren’t mine because they were friends with them first so I essentially cut off a good five or ten people. Then I had my one friend who was mine and only mine. She got a boyfriend near the end of high school as well though. We were still close, but I rarely saw her. Then they broke up two years ago, and we’ve been super close for the past two years. Until recently. She got a new boyfriend and I hardly see her or talk to her anymore. My sister who I’ve always been close with has a long term boyfriend too, and I’m considered the third wheel to their relationship so I don’t hang out with them much either. One of my friends from high school who I cut off recently got back in touch with me and we’ve been getting close again. But about a month ago she got a new boyfriend and I haven’t talked to her since. Another of my friends just moved a 20 hour drive away for school. Another one just moved to a new continent for a study abroad program for a year. I thought my mental health was getting better. But with all of this happening, I feel like I’m back to being thirteen years old and not wanting to get out of bed at all.","I feel like I have no friends There’s a long backstory to part of my feelings around this topic, but the basics are that I have a twin and we’ve always shared everything, including friends; nearing the end of high school they got really annoyed with this and told me all our friends weren’t mine because they were friends with them first so I essentially cut off a good five or ten people.

Every cell in the human body emits a unique frequency and your brain puts out a frequency which can be picked up by other brains.,"It can pass through anything because It basically is the same frequency type that a radio transmitter puts out. The frequency that you're transmitting from your brain is smaller, but, it has a unique characteristic, unlike radio frequencies. Which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously travel faster than the speed of light and if transmitted can be picked up the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet. (Energy and frequency are the same.) Everything on planet Earth emits a different frequency. A frequency is also called a vibration. It's also called Energy. It is quantifiable and it is measurable. Every atom emits a frequency. Your DNA at the lowest level emits a unique frequency. So your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency. That's the first concept and the second concept is the Law of attraction. Which says, whatever frequency you emit, That exact same frequency is drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull. And this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. When you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. Law of Attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back. Which is based on whatever vibration you put out Whatever frequency that your brain, emotions, body and electromagnetic field puts out. It will attract and it will defy any physical law. Self-induced goosebumps, from positive stimulis, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body, and is also able to, as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot) vibrate your whole physical body. When doing so, you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when consciously summoning your self-induced goosebumps. Goosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as Energy. I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more. If you would like to know how to activate at will, fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction, Here's a five minute video explaining just that.

Physical symptoms?,"Hi, just wanted to ask if stress can cause many many weird physical symptoms? All started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks, took 3 covid tests and all negative. During the same time my right arm started to hurt, then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb (not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight). I also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff (a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too - like really can’t move it). And my jaw hurts a lot on the right side - that jaw thing has been going of for the last year, dentists say nothing is wrong. I noticed that I clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe I am just so stressed and this is the outcome. But right now I don’t clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back (with all these new symptoms). Anyway I have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now I am waiting for MRIs (neuro wants to eliminate MS). When this all first started I didn’t feel more stressed or anything but now of course I am stressed. I feel kinda fine some days and then the other days (like today) my arm and leg are in so much pain (I think nerve pain, my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too) and I just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like I want to cry. So I guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety? My neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that “maybe you are just stressed”. Of course I don’t want to get diagnose like MS from my neuro but at the same time I really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms. Have anyone had similar physical symptoms and turned out it was just stress or anxiety? Could stress really make me be physically in pain or numb like this?","Physical symptoms?

"I found a unsent ""letter"" from my mom to my grandma and now I'm heartbroken.","My mom is away on vacation and I know she has some edibles hidden in her drawer so I thought it'd be a good idea to steal a couple while she was gone. I know I shouldn't have been doing that but that's honestly not important to me right now, sorry. While grabbing the jar of gummies, I found a note right next to it. The note reads as a letter that my mom wrote to her mom (who passed away about 15 years ago). the TLDR of the letter is that my mom wished she knew the things she knows now as a parent when she was younger because she never appreciated how hard her mom worked for her. She went into how she thinks she failed me because of my depression (I'm open with my depression to my mom and she is supportive) and that being a parent is hard but she's trying her best but her best isn't enough. My mom has never spoken to me about her depression, although she has mentioned it very briefly, but reading that letter broke me harder than anything I can remember. I just started bawling, still am while writing this. My mom is the most important thing to me in the world and learning that she thinks she is a failure makes me have suicidal thoughts because of how broken I feel about this. But now I feel the pressure of making my mom proud and making sure she feels like she isn't a failure, so obviously suicide is off the table, at least until after she passes. I just don't know if I have it in me to turn things around, my depression has been the same ever since I was diagnosed with it in HS (I'm 26 now). I'm going to try to go out of my way and hug her more and tell her I love her and how much I appreciate her but I don't think I'll ever get over knowing how she really feels about herself.

I hate how people boast about how much they support mental illness then once they meet a mentally ill person they want nothing to do with them,"It's just so fucking tiresome. You see it everywhere on social media.

Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed. I'm not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences.

I want to cry. I feel like the dumbest person in the world.,"I’m 25 and currently taking a college precalculus course at community college so that I can have a better future. I grew up poor and getting a good education is a way for me to break free from poverty. I’ve been acing all my classes up until this class which I currently have an 89% in but I have a feeling it might drop significantly due to the fact that I don’t understand the 2 chapters that we were taught. I have a 2 chapter exam and a finals back to back in 12 days since this class is a summer math course and is only 4 weeks. We are currently learning matrices and I just don’t get it no matter how hard I try. We were supposed to be taught how to do this since middle school and high school algebra but of course I went to a pretty bad school and was never taught how to do basic row echelon forms. I feel so left behind compared to the rest of my class. Everyday I study for more than 5 hours and I just cannot pick things up. I go to tutoring sessions, ask professors and students for help and I just can’t understand this chapter. I’ve tried YouTube videos and even performing problems on my own, but it just causes this overwhelming feeling in my brain which I cannot really describe. I wake up at 5am to prepare for this class on top of going to work. My parents are very stressed and tired and I just want to excel in school, make them proud, and take care of them in the future. Right now, I am so scared my GPA will drop since I want to transfer into a good school. I wish I did better in high school so I don’t have to deal with going to school as an adult.","I want to cry.

I’m starting to think things will never get better and I’m afraid I know how I’ll end up. (TW),"I’m 20. My depression started at age 4. I went through emotional, mental, and sexual abuse as a child and was in therapy from ages 11-18 because of it. Things got better for a bit, and then got worse.

I’m constantly stressed about money even though I’m debt free,"I’ve had a normal upbringing, my parents were firmly middle class and saved up a lot. But they came from poor families. So they expect me to be as wealthy as they are (and more). I don’t have any debt which is great, and I’d like to get a mortgage soon as well, but I keep worrying about money. My partner has unsteady income which stresses me out on his behalf. I have a steady job, don’t make a fortune but it’s safe and have career prospects. I read somewhere that most milenials are worried about money. That doesn’t surprise me. Anyone else out there feel the same?

First steps- think I might be depressed and don't know where to go initially,"So, I’m not sure exactly what sort of mental health professional I need to make an appointment with (therapist, psychologist, etc), but I feel I need to and would appreciate any advice. I’ve been feeling not quite myself for about six months now. I know everyone is dealing with issues trying to live through a pandemic- and I had been holding up fairly well until just recently. Right before the pandemic, my dad died kind of unexpectedly, and I really hadn’t been able to spend time to grieve that before we were thrust into this weird time we’re in now. I would not say I am severely depressed, but it’s almost like I have the pervasive question in my head of “what’s the point of living/ what’s the purpose?” To be clear- I am not suicidal (in fact, the thought of killing myself is extremely scary to me- I’m scared of death). But I just feel kind of ‘meh’ about life lately. I feel like my emotional bucket is empty. I don’t know if this is just really persistent right now because of the current pandemic, or if I need to be medicated. And then, if I did need to be, how that works. Is that something you can do to get you over the hump, or is that something you have to be on permanently? TIA!","First steps- think I might be depressed and don't know where to go initially So, I’m not sure exactly what sort of mental health professional I need to make an appointment with (therapist, psychologist, etc), but I feel I need to and would appreciate any advice.

Stress during specific classes,"I’m taking online classes just lake a majority of the population right now and I have 7 classes I am taking, we do A and B scheduling but one specific class stresses me out so much. And I’m really confused as to why this is happening it’s not like the class assignments are a lot we get a fair amount of work but not a lot. But every time I’m in that class or go to do the work for that class my heart beats so fast to the point where I feel like it’s going to come out of my chest and my breathing gets all heavy and I get a stomach and head ache and it takes a bit for me to calm down. I have not been diagnosed with any sort of anxiety nor am I going to self diagnose. But it has really become a burden because it takes me half an hour or so to calm myself down, on top of that the class requires cameras to be on and don’t mind it but I will literally be in so much panic and I have to pretend I’m fine on camera because of obvious reasons. I just got out of said class while typing this out and im still on edge and my hands are shaking i just hope this can stop soon because this is a class I can’t get out of doing until next school year..If anyone has any tips or advise I would greatly appreciate it.","Stress during specific classes I’m taking online classes just lake a majority of the population right now and I have 7 classes I am taking, we do A and B scheduling but one specific class stresses me out so much.

Can stress impact physical health ?,"I've been under a lot of stress past 7 years due bipolar disorder which has dramatically escalated past few years. I'm living in my 9th city 5th country. My third country within a year. Having just moved here I found out I may be getting fired due to a dispute between a client and my employer with me being caught in the middle. My tenants stopped paying rent and turned my house into a hostel so had to evict them . My brother died , I recently got an MRI to check for prostate cancer. My mother got made redundant so I've been sending money to her and sometimes to my dead brothers wife and children when they're broke. Stress seems to manifest in very real physical symptoms in me. My possible job loss and likely moving countries again destabalised my mood. I started suffering from extreme fatigue depression paranoia my blood pressure went to 160/90 and my thyroid seems to be cycling from below reference range to above reference range.

High-functioning depression I feel like I'm living a double life.,"I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible. From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.","High-functioning depression I feel like I'm living a double life.

New Job,"Good Day. I just got promoted to a brand new section at work. I went from being the top producer in my division to going over to a completely new division and I started in a supervisory role. I’m very lost. I know generally about what I’m supposed to be doing, but I feel like such a disappointment because I can’t answer my employees questions. Every single thing I see is brand new to me and I get so stressed out because I have a limited support system of people to ask questions to. Everyone is working from home so I can’t even have the luxury of learning a little bit by walking around and interacting with my people. I like the people, but a lot of them are low performers so I have to start with corrective actions before too long. All the other supervisory roles are vacant so I’m doing work for 3 teams. And my boss is new as well so I can’t really go to her, because she doesn’t know the answer either. I’m so stressed and every single day I get about 20 small fires I need to put out and several large fires and I have no idea how to solve any of them. Nobody has offered any training materials or support so I have had to find them all myself. The worst part is I put in for a supervisory position in my own division, but I was pulled over to this team because there were so many vacancies. So I have to do admin work for a huge team, start hiring processes, start performance appraisals (Despite me only being there 2 weeks), I sign off on all their work (I don’t know for sure if they’re doing everything right, but I simply don’t have the time to check everything and ask questions about everything), I get escalated all of the tough things and I get all the heat when things aren’t going great. Bottom line, I am so stressed out and every day after work I cry because I feel so terrible and I just sit there sad and eating unhealthy food because my energy has been sucked and my motivation is gone. I had such a relaxing (although boring) job before and in trying to expand my horizons I’ve landed in a personal hell. I hate every second of being alive right now and any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks.","New Job Good Day. I just got promoted to a brand new section at work.

"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days.","Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days. I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway! I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free! I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?! I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?) Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!) The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself) This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city. I’m so proud of myself! Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay) I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time! I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me busy.

First time going for therapy and my therapist cried,"Recently I’ve been feeling dangerously numb again and I’m… just… very exhausted. I’ve lived 22 years feeling like I’m dead and if I don’t get help now, I will probably be dead in my 30’s. It was last Friday. I was very nervous because I felt some sort of shame for making this person listen to me talk about my childhood for 2 hours. I felt selfish. Inside I kept thinking, “okay, what should I talk about next?” and it was almost as though I was selecting a book off a shelf to read aloud to this lady opposite me. And these are books you’ve written and read countless times before and reading it one more time feels like nothing to you. But then she started crying. Before we had started, she placed a tissue box next to me and said that I might need it, but in a reversal of events, I’m the one panicking. She said that the image of child me living in constant emotional abuse and neglect for almost 18 years broke her heart. After I went home, I cried too. I’ve forgotten that I shouldn’t be used to it, and that it is okay for me to cry, to feel sorrow for the child who was once me. That I don’t have to play it off as the past, or compartmentalize my feelings, that I am still very haunted even as an adult.","First time going for therapy and my therapist cried Recently I’ve been feeling dangerously numb again and I’m… just… very exhausted.

I feel like I'm suffocating,"I don't know if it's relevant for this post, I'm a 27-year-old woman. My ex of (almost) seven years, broke up with me 5 months ago. We weren't happy, and I think that my diagnosis (Personality disorder(s) with comorbid depression and other stuff), helped him with that decision. Because of that, I had to move back to my parents, I can't afford to live alone because my therapy consumes a good chunk of my salary. I feel like I'm suffocating like I have this pressure on my chest and throat. It's hard to breathe. I'm constantly on the verge of crying, not because I miss my ex, but because I have this feeling, or rather I'm sure that my life is and is going to be miserable. I see no future and hope for myself. I have enough of my life, this neverending vicious cycle, the same routine everyday. I wake up, get dressed, go for a walk with my dog, work, go for a walk, exercise, walk the dog. Everyday is the same. I eat the same food, wear the same clothes, nothing changes. Or rather I don't change, but everything around me is constantly changing, and I am stuck, slowly suffocating, barely being able to pull my shit together. I'm in this place right now, that I would give anything to be able to feel anything, I want to get drunk, high, just to feel something different. I want to meet new people, have affairs, travel, disappear. But I can't... I'm stuck in the ivory tower, my prison, my room. I try to get out more, be more sociable, but every time I match with someone on a dating app I begin to feel so heartbroken (?) like I know that nothing will ever come out of this because I'm too scared to get out of my room and go on a date. I fear, that they will not like me, find me attractive enough. That's why I stick to texting and ghosting people when they ask me out. I know it's horrible. But I can't help it. I'm a failure, yet I'm so frightened to be perceived as one. And I know that I'm quite good-looking, in good shape, and I can be fun to be around. But lately, I feel like a potato sack, unattractive, with nothing to offer. I feel like I'm going to end up all alone, resenting everyone, because they have something, that I won't ever get - happiness and peace of mind. P.S. sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, English is my second language.","I feel like I'm suffocating I don't know if it's relevant for this post, I'm a 27-year-old woman.

I'm forced to move home (into a 1-person rental for the first time) and my employer throwing us through an organisational restructure at the same time. The stress is colossal and I don't think I'll find a way out of all this alive. What can I do to manage all the stress?,"So, the stress I'm trying to manage is quite the beast. I've put it in dot points to help separate each stressor, but it's still a mess, so sorry in advance! * Work has been putting us through a restructure since July 2020. * My job doesn't exist in the new structure, and I'm genuinely terrified that I lack the skillsets to do any of the jobs, even in a learning capacity. I've applied for a few jobs in the new structure to further my career, but I've failed to get a single interview to date. * I'm terrified about looking outside my current employer, as I'd have to start all over again. My skillset has unfortunately only become relevant to the employer I'm with. I graduated a bachelor in Information Technology in 2016, but it's been so long since then that I've actually forgotten most of the programming stuff I did, and starting again will put me back into the suicide mentality (I think I'm really shit at it, but it's all I have and I don't want to go through the additional stress of reskilling or going back to a shitty retail job that will just make me hang myself in 6 months. Taking an entry-level job at work also isn't an option, as there is no career progression here unless you basically do someone else's job because they're too shit to do it themselves. That's how I got into my current job, and I absolutely don't want to go back to answering the phones again. Backwards is not an option. * The last batch of jobs in the new structure came out yesterday and finish in 2 weeks. Applying for these takes about 5-6 hours each, as they want you to write a billion fucking things as part of the application, and each job's application requirements are different from the last. * I had to move out. * My situation with flatmates was a risk to my health and immediate safety, so I need to jump ship ASAP. Due to COVID-19, no-one is moving (0.1% of homes in my city and surrounding cities available to rent this month, as opposed to \~10% this time last year), meaning every place I inspected had over 30 people apply for them. I never heard back regarding my applications. Fortunately, my cousin's friend bought a place and desperately needs someone to fill it. The rent is higher than what I was looking for by about $100/week, but due to COVID-19, the rental market is fucked right now and has driven the rent prices up everywhere in my state in my country. He offered me the place, but it's unfurnished, so I need to purchase all the furniture and appliances and organise all the amenities. Due to my job instability, I literally don't know if I can afford anything should I find myself unemployed and burning money to keep myself afloat. I didn't want to be in a position where I have to move home and find a new job simultaneously. I simply don't have the mental capacity to handle both of these all on my own, even with the help my psychologist provides and friends doing their best to help me out where they can. I'm genuinely terrified that it's all going to be too much and I'll kill myself very soon or later this year if this stress goes on for too long. Any tips on managing this fucking nightmare my life is right now? ​ Edit While my employer couldn't pick a worse time to choose to restructure, they've got a contract with a career support service that has helped with resume sculpting and interview preparation, but I feel super inadequate and a bit of a lost cause. Edit 2 my dog of 13 years died this morning, so the last 6 months can fuck off, and then fuck off again.","I'm forced to move home (into a 1-person rental for the first time) and my employer throwing us through an organisational restructure at the same time.

Everything Sucks,"Everything fucking sucks. All school does is make me fucking stressed with mocks, family pushing down every inch of me into the ground. I broke down in my room, and my dad comes in almost straight afterwards and just tells me to remember to give him a fucking report next week when my priority is mocks. They yell at me a couple of times a week for dumb shit such as not answering my phone when I am 1 room away from them. I get top grades for them, working my ass off and they never even care about it even my mom saying I don't care what you get. That shit just stabs me in the heart. Then there's school which is just throwing dagger after dagger, essay after essay, exam after exam, asking you to work afterschool when I want is a break. My friends don't bother to ask me to hang with them, only talking to me if they need help with school work. I always have to aim for high scores because I'm expected to and if I don't it means I fucked up even if I get an average score. There is so many different things running through my head that I just snapped today. Cried for a while. I don't even know why I'm typing this. I've never used reddit before. I just want to put this out there because I hide everything from everyone because I'm too scared of what they'll think.","Everything Sucks Everything fucking sucks.

"If someone could help me out after having read my rent I would he grateful, and if not that's fine as well.","Hello people, My life feels at this moment worthless, I wouldn't mind someone taking it away, (at least having said that , that's out of the way). School started again, in my final year now I turned 18, the beginning of the end of school. But because of complications (mental health) I had to redo a year a while ago. All my friends have left now, and I feel very stuck and alone everywhere, in school, with my family, I'm not the person I was during my vacation, I've changed again to the back old stressed and scared me. And I hate it. It's hard because I just don't want any people around me, yet I also feel the need for someone. But I can't bring up the motivation or will power to do so, and I'm in this constant state of not really being there. I don't see any way how to build up a friendship with someone I see at school for example. While I definitely need such a thing. Everyone seems so not on the same level, and I think well that's not gonna work out. Besides that minor stuff stresses me, I'm no longer mindful in any way. I feel so god damn hopeless, and so scared for the future, so immense scared, that I'll fuck up. I can't even go to bed, simply because every part in my brain wants to stay awake, no matter how tired I am, I try to stay awake, until I can't no more, because I've no motivation to fall asleep and start the day over again. I really don't know what to do at this point. I'm still on a waiting list for therapy, and as it seems it will for sure take another month if I'm lucky (most likely 3 months). Everything in me just surches for escapes, it's sleep deprivation, or I grab alcohol, while I pledged to not drink. I can be way more impulsive than normally. It's weird. All this combined with moments of de-realization. I don't know what is going on with me the last week's, but I'll not be able to continue in this way. I feel a stranger in my own body, in this world, with everyone... Could someone please explain me why this all happens. And what could help, or yeah, I don't really know.

Just because someone has it worse doesn’t make your pain unjustified.,"I hate when people say something along the lines of, “This guy got through this, so you’ll be fine.” When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they’d want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I’m sure it’s the same for them. It’s toxic and it won’t make someone who’s depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, “Being stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.” Just because the blades smaller doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. The only reason I’m posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don’t know what to say, but I would think they’d understand it wouldn’t make it any better just because some other guy had it worse. While yes it can bring someone who’s whining about something trivial to perspective, there’s a line that’s crossed when you tell something like that to someone who’s actually going through depression/tough times. It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don’t know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless.","Just because someone has it worse doesn’t make your pain unjustified.

My anti stress plan,"I've been dealing with a life-altering chronic illness for the last 2 years. Historically, I deal with stress with weight-lifting, cardio, and dance (I used to train 7 to 14 hours a week) Since I've become sick, I've lost all of my friends, can no longer dance, and can't weight lift. I know that stress exacerbates my illness, but the illness also causes most of my stress and robs me of my life-long tools for dealing with stress. I'm directly dealing with stress, but here's my overall plan * Make better use of a calendar to plan responsibilities. That way, I can forget about the problem until the reminder shows up. * Put things in perspective and accept the bad things in life/work instead of worry about them * Try to laugh and smile * Take a cold shower when I get home from work. ​ Not sure how well this will work, but I am determined to try something so that, while I may be in physical pain every day, I won't be mentally making things worse.

What the????,"Throwaway. Hear me out, please. I feel as if my life will never get better. I just started college after a horrendous high school experience complete with bullying and exclusion. College isn't shaping up to be much better so far despite inspiring words by those around me and personal hopes. I spend my days after class wandering around looking for people to hang out with. I sometimes get a few snapchats for later contacts but they never really turn out to be anything. I feel incredibly lonely and it's going on 5 years of this. I don't know what to do/I don't know if I can do it. It's like God really wants me to eradicate myself. I really want to find myself a group of friends that 110% enjoys me for who I am. I want to find myself a girl that 110% enjoys me for who I am. Getting here to college has intensified a lot of things, not just the loneliness. All of the guys around me are rushing but since I'm trans, I don't feel comfortable doing so. That makes me even more depressed because if I wasn't trans, I would be able to do something like that. I'm at risk of getting the shit kicked out of me for trying to join a frat just because I'm trans. Me being trans also makes things difficult finding a girlfriend. I'm 18 damn years old and have never had anything beyond a platonic hug. Kinda pathetic and I want to change that asap. I'm not ugly, I'm just trans and I don't think many girls in Southern Virginia want a trans dude. I'm really struggling to find a solution to the pain I'm feeling. I've been trying for actual years and I'm reaching the end of my rope. I'm struggling to stay on top of school work and keeping myself healthy. I don't have anything to motivate me to do so. From my point of view, my future is a repeated cycle of what I've already experienced shittiness. I know life is anything but fair but what am I supposed to do? Continue living like this? It just keeps getting harder. I don't want to kill myself because something in the back of my mind says eventually things will get better and I will eventually be married to the love of my life in our farmhouse with our beautiful children but what am I supposed to do in the meantime? I just want to drive and drive until I forget everything but I left my car at my parents' to go to college. I seriously don't know how long it will take to feel okay and I'm tired of testing it. I cried for the first time in at least a month (a long time for me) this morning because I woke up and the first thing on my mind is where are my friends? Wait I don't have any. Please give me advice on how to miraculously pull myself out of this. I need to find myself a support group, a girl, and a purpose asap and I don't know where to start. Thanks.","What the???? Throwaway. Hear me out, please. I feel as if my life will never get better. I just started college after a horrendous high school experience complete with bullying and exclusion.

Have you ever had seasonal affective disorder in summer?,I normally get it in winter but last winter was so severe (-50C/-58F) that I'm already dreading this upcoming winter.

17 yo don't have a fucking clue about life,"Hey, I've been so stressful with the things going on in my life ( finishing highschool, college exam, pandemic process etc. ) Actually it's mostly about my exam because in my country it's hard to find a valuable job without college our economy is going worse day by day so I think I must do it. And in Turkey it's also so stressful in these times for people because all the thing is depended on a single exam we do end of the year ( literally a single one day test we take ). Whether thinking about it or life I find myself always being sad because of a certain thing and I can't remember all of them in one tho. I feel like I'm not growing or I didn't grew at all I'm shorter than my coevals. My penis size is embarrassingly small. And in this young age I have a visually perceivable hair loss. I don't know. Tonight I'm sad with my hairs and that's why I decided to write. And I don't know what you people can help with but. I just feel sad and shitty. Maybe hair can be cured but I don't know anything about it tho. They started falling when I grew em longer than usually I use, and when I cutted them again they just didn't stop to. Now when I look into mirror and see baldy parts I hate my life. And I know this stress just makes everything worse but I want to have a normal penis, a not falling hair ( at least at my fucking 17th year ) and a nice college life but it seems I'm far far away from all of these. Also I'm fat and I want to exercise and shit but first I need to get start from somewhere with studying and then I think I can make all of these with an order. In the end it still seems like I can't do anything with the other 2 things. I don't know if it's the right place to write this down but I think I'm depressed since my 7th grade because just how life basically works.

Dating is stressful but do it because i want love.,I (28f) absolutely hate dating but i want love. I’m constantly stressing myself out whenever i become interested in a new guy.

I stress when I’m with him and i can’t read if he’s interested. Then i stress when i think he’s just being nice when i ask him something and he gives a good answer. Of course i ALWAYS play it cool. Like laughing it off when he flakes. Or saying no worries when he cancels. Or giving him space when i don’t want to look too clingy. But inside I’m going crazy! I want to turn this worrying off.

I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,"depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse"" ​ I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky. If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police?

Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist? ​ An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it. ​ I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20.

Talking to my Dr. tomorrow about adjusting my meds,"Hi all, first time posting in r/depression. I (F/42) have probably been battling it all my life but it was manageable until I had kids. I likely have mild ADD as well. I used very intense exercise to cope with both before. I still exercise every day, but I can’t do it with the same intensity that I used to because of my age, previous injuries, and just the fact that I have no time to recover from intense workouts. My main symptoms are irritability (likely caused by anxiety), feelings of hopelessness, and loss of interest/inability to experience happiness. I go through the motions but don’t experience enjoyment on any level. I feel insecure and stressed in social situations. I’ve worked with a therapist before (have gone through many, in fact) but have found the process unhelpful and even harmful at times, but that’s a different post. I struggled for a year and a half to find a medication that would work for me but I’m extremely sensitive to side effects. Here is a list of what I’ve tried so far and the effects I experienced, both good and bad. Zoloft (Sertraline) - drowsiness, emotional flatness, loss of interest and creativity, some relief from tearfulness Trintellix (vortoxetine) - upset stomach, g.i. Issues, no discernible relief from depression Prozac (fluoxetine) - very intense headache. Only took it once Lamictal (lamotregine) - (off label) allergic reaction itching, redness Lexapro (escitolopram) - hair loss, nausea, no relief from depression Wellbutrin (bupropion) - anxiety, nausea, no discernible relief from depression Cymbalta (duloxetine) - I was prescribed this, but was actually too terrified of the side effects to take it ADHD meds Adderall headache, backache, major crash helped with interest and focus but I felt too bad to do much Dexadrine headache with crash, helped with interest but not focus Ritalin sedating Vyvanse helpful with interest, mood, and focus. Extreme irritability with crash. I am currently only taking 25 mil. of sertraline. Any more and I can’t get up off the couch. Any less and I don’t sleep at night. It’s obviously not cutting it but I’m absolutely terrified of taking anything else. I don’t have a support system to take up the slack if I’m sick for longer than a day or two. My relatives all live far away (and they’re not very helpful anyway). My husband works all the time, as he is the main breadwinner. I have a friendly neighbor or two, but not someone who would take the kids for more than a few hours. It’s me or nothing, and I think that might be a big contributor to my problems. I’m talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow but I know he’s kind of out of ideas. I’m thinking about asking for the lowest dose of Vyvanse possible. I have no clue what to do about the antidepressants. He doesn’t want to repeat a medication and he doesn’t want to prescribe older meds as they tend to cause more side effects. Is there anything we might have missed? Are there any combinations or supplements that can make side effects more tolerable? Thanks in advance.","Talking to my Dr. tomorrow about adjusting my meds Hi all, first time posting in r/depression.

Zoloft (Sertraline) - drowsiness, emotional flatness, loss of interest and creativity, some relief from tearfulness Trintellix (vortoxetine) - upset stomach, g.i. Issues, no discernible relief from depression Prozac (fluoxetine) - very intense headache. Only took it once Lamictal (lamotregine) - (off label) allergic reaction itching, redness Lexapro (escitolopram) - hair loss, nausea, no relief from depression Wellbutrin (bupropion) - anxiety, nausea, no discernible relief from depression Cymbalta (duloxetine) - I was prescribed this, but was actually too terrified of the side effects to take it ADHD meds Adderall headache, backache, major crash helped with interest and focus but I felt too bad to do much Dexadrine headache with crash, helped with interest but not focus Ritalin sedating Vyvanse helpful with interest, mood, and focus. Extreme irritability with crash. I am currently only taking 25 mil. of sertraline. Any more and I can’t get up off the couch. Any less and I don’t sleep at night. It’s obviously not cutting it but I’m absolutely terrified of taking anything else. I don’t have a support system to take up the slack if I’m sick for longer than a day or two. My relatives all live far away (and they’re not very helpful anyway). My husband works all the time, as he is the main breadwinner. I have a friendly neighbor or two, but not someone who would take the kids for more than a few hours. It’s me or nothing, and I think that might be a big contributor to my problems. I’m talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow but I know he’s kind of out of ideas. I’m thinking about asking for the lowest dose of Vyvanse possible. I have no clue what to do about the antidepressants. He doesn’t want to repeat a medication and he doesn’t want to prescribe older meds as they tend to cause more side effects. Is there anything we might have missed? Are there any combinations or supplements that can make side effects more tolerable? Thanks in advance.",1
college,"Like remember how we all picked our college major based on something we kinda liked in high school and like everything was ok until you started getting really depressed and now you like don't want to do your major anymore cause you're a STEM major and like you have a lot of work, but like sleeping and never leaving your dorm sounds better and like even tho you love your major you're just so stressed and like wanna switch to something easier like psych or English and then you realize you hate that too and finals are this week and orgo is a pain in the ass and like youre panicking cause you could lose your scholarship if you don't agree to continue research next semester cause you were short 2 credits last year cause you had to go to the hospital.. cause like same )","college Like remember how we all picked our college major based on something we kinda liked in high school and like everything was ok until you started getting really depressed and now you like don't want to do your major anymore cause you're a STEM major and like you have a lot of work, but like sleeping and never leaving your dorm sounds better and like even tho you love your major you're just so stressed and like wanna switch to something easier like psych or English and then you realize you hate that too and finals are this week and orgo is a pain in the ass and like youre panicking cause you could lose your scholarship if you don't agree to continue research next semester cause you were short 2 credits last year cause you had to go to the hospital.. cause like same )",1
My best friend proposed to me this morning and I just want the world to know!,"He cooked me breakfast this morning, I thought it was going to be like any other day. After breakfast he comes up to me and starts telling me how happy he is to be with me and how much he is looking forward to our future...it was very out of character for him so I knew something was up. Then out of the corner of my eye I see him grab a bag of cat treats and he calls my cat, who is the biggest love of my life lol, and he had the ring tied around a string on her neck. So he literally got my cat to propose! It was adorable and I am so happy. The ring doesn't fit but he gave me his mother's wedding ring (his dad has passed) which made it even more special. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with this man and I just wanted to share the news!!","My best friend proposed to me this morning and I just want the world to know!

I’m Quarantined Away From My Baby and My Boyfriend Is No Help,"Info BF has manic depression (it’s what he calls his diagnosis. I’m aware that it’s called bipolar disorder now but, I’m respecting his label for his own mental health disorder.) He’s on meds that he takes off an on because his sleep schedule is messed up due to a new job and he’s supposed to take them every 24 hours before bed. He’s been off of them for 3 day. I feel like he is acting like this because he is off his meds. I have depression, anxiety and, PTSD. I’m on Zoloft, buspar and, the mini pill. I’m currently off of the Zoloft and buspar due to all of my life changes which has amped up my depression and PTSD symptoms. I’ve run out of my mini pill which helps with anxiety so I imagine that will get worse if I can’t get a refill soon. Actual Post Hey. I have to quarantine away from my baby because I’m really sick and my partner tested positive. I’m really depressed about it and idk what to do to stop crying. I’ve been crying for 2 days. I feel so empty without her. She’s getting over RSV and has an ear infection in both ears so it’s better for her to be at her father’s away from me but, every instinct in my body is screaming to have her safe in my arms. I just can’t stop crying. I already have depression anxiety and ptsd and I think that this is feeding into those. Im off my meds rn because my hospital sold my doctor’s practice plus I moved to a new county so I have to find a new doctor to get the right meds. Now that’ll have to wait for this quarantine. I didn’t hug her enough before she left with him. I was sick and it hurt to be touched and I just didn’t snuggle her enough. She looked at me through FaceTime yesterday and cried wanting me. She just kept reaching for me through the phone and didn’t understand why I couldn’t hold her. Im also dealing with jealousy because my ex’s new girlfriend is seeing her everyday and getting to love on her and hold her and play with her. I know that it’s selfish but, this girl wants to be a mother badly and it feels as if she’s stealing my baby. I know that she’s not stealing her but, it feels that way. I just want her home. How am I supposed to do 10 days of this? How am I supposed to go from seeing holding her and loving on her everyday to not at all. This is so hard. My boyfriend has 3 kids that he’s across the country from so, he’s desensitized to it. For him it’s been his life for 2 years so he doesn’t understand why it’s such a big deal. He just wants me to magically get better. He has his own depression and says that it’s not good for him to be around someone so depressed, which is valid but, it still hurts to hear. He says that I need to work harder to fix it. He says that I’m not working hard enough. Idk what he wants me to do in isolation that I haven’t been doing for years already. I’ve been suicidally depressed since I was a little girl due to be in an abusive home. I’ve been to numerous healthcare professionals and on multiple meds and combinations of meds for years. It isn’t an overnight fix and I don’t think that he understands that. He wants me to reach out to people around me and people on Facebook and stuff but, I don’t talk about my mental health issues with people. When I’ve tried in the past people just treated me like I was crazy or expected it to be fixed overnight or very quickly blamed every little thing they didn’t like about me on my mental illnesses and then dumped me because of them. I became stigmatized very quickly and I hated it. It’s embarrassing to talk about in general. A lot of people depend on me and this shows me as being a undependable person. That’s how I get treated when I mention it at least. He openly talks about his mental health to anyone who listens and I worry that he burdens others with it and I don’t want to burden others too. That gets exhausting for people very quickly. He said that reaching out like that is what will fix it quicker though. Idk why I’m just an object to be fixed to him. When he keeps asking how we can fix it I just want to scream. Like, am I not allowed to just feel it for a second? Can I not just be sad for a couple days then move on from it and that be okay? Why is it wrong for me to just cope with it in my own way? He asked for me to be more emotional. I’m usually a very logical person as a defense mechanism to hide this part of myself and protect it. I don’t show emotions to anyone. He asked me to because he hated that logical defense mechanism. He broke those walls down. I warned him about this multiple times. He said that he could handle it. Now, every time I have any emotion whether it’s excitement, happiness, anger or, depression, he says that it’s too much for him to handle. He distances himself from me. I tried to express that to him and he actively denied doing it. He said that he’s just communicating. It’s great that he is but he’s confirming that I am a burden by doing that. Why ask me to be emotional if you can’t take those emotions on? Why offer support only to wrench it away so suddenly when I need it most? He’s so supportive and loving with all of his friends and takes every emotion of theirs in stride with his own. He sometimes puts me on the back burner to do so. Why can he do that with them but, not me? Why can he just so readily be there like he promised without trying to just fix everything but, not do that for me? Why am I just something to be fixed? Why am I the one that’s too much for him? He says that I’m sad all the time. I pointed out that the majority of time that I’m chipper and happy and high energy and he hates that. He says that it’s too much which forces me to either be neutral or have a negative emotion. He just brushed by that statement and never addressed it. Like, what does he want from me here? I feel like I can’t win. I’m just struggling and need someone and he promised to be that someone and now it feels like he’s dropped me in an ocean after trying to rescue me from it and I’m drowning. I want to go back to not feeling but, he hates that too. I asked him what the point of me being here is then. I asked him what I do for him. He says that I give him something to look forward to when he wakes up in the morning. Idk what to do with that. It makes me feel like a warm body to just fill space. He says that he isn’t ready to go full on commitment and be super serious but, we’ve moved in together in his place because he thought that it’d be a good idea. We said I love you only for him to recently admit that he said that out of an intimate love for me but, he isn’t in love with me. He doesn’t want to be serious but then he keeps trying to break down my walls and expects me to just pour all of my emotions out to him even though he can’t handle it. He doesn’t want anything but also wants everything and I’m going through emotional whiplash. Idk how this turned into a rant about him. I just. I’m depressed and I’m not doing good and he is my one form of support and I’ve lost it. I just want my daughter home and in my arms. I guess that this whole thing is just a rant. I’m just gonna walk back inside with a fake smile on my face I guess so that he can think that I’m magically better. What’s ironic is he told me to open up to people and that my fears of what they’ll do is just stigma and unfounded but, he’s doing the exact thing that I was scared of this entire time. He essentially proved me right. I’m all alone and no one will ever be able to help me. Thanks for reading. If you have any tips for getting out of this depressive rut until I can get a new psychologist and new meds you’d be my knights in shining armor. Rn I’m on Zoloft and buspar at the highest doses but they make me feel drunk and I can’t take those while caring for a daughter even though they do work outside of that. If you have any medication recommendations as well, I’d love to hear them.

Do you always find yourself ruminating on the same event every depressive episode?,"For context I’m a 33f, married for 6 years and with my husband for the last 15 years (minus a year on-and-off period). During that on-and-off time, I was very depressed and my now husband broke up with me in a very shitty way and did a few things that hurt me badly. I decided to get back together with him anyways because I couldn’t imagine not being with him. He’s a good person, he’s never given me any reason to think he’d do any of those things again, I trust him etc. etc. BUT every time I go into a depressive period (which is every 2-3 years), I ruminate on that time. I become super critical of our marriage and him, when before the depression I’d say we’re happy. I think because it was my first major depression, my brain wires itself to go there. I’m in therapy to talk about it now. I’m wondering if anyone else revisits the same trauma when they’re depressed?","Do you always find yourself ruminating on the same event every depressive episode?

School pressure,"I am currently doing A-levels and I am in my final year, in year 13. No matter what I do I cannot force myself to study. I can’t study more than five minutes because I just feel like crying whenever I study I don’t know what is wrong with me. I know and love education because I know it is the key to success and education is vital to life. I love the importance of it and know how privileged I am to receive an education. But somehow I cannot study and Do anything school related. I’m trying to talk to people around me about it but I just feel like crying because no one understands how I feel. I want to study but I can’t and every time I just feel like crying because I feel like I’m failing in my education. I am scared that if I feel I would let my family down. I think I may be scared of the idea of failing and letting my family down or it could be that school is sucking the fun out of education for me. Also, sometimes I feel like my education will go to waste because I am not allowed to work because I have to take care of someone and my dad brings the income. I feel like the main goal right now is to study and I’m failing because 1) I feel that I’m too scared to start studying because I will fail and 2) my education will go to waste as I’m not going to work due to other responsibilities so what is the point of studying? I’m not exactly sure what it is and my feelings are mixed. Sometimes I also worry about the future and think like if I feel my education and I am not working or doing anything I’m just at home feeling like a waste of space. I’m so confused. Can someone please help me out with suggest what I should do? Ps. Sorry if this doesn’t make any sense because I’m literally just feeling a mix of emotions and different things and it is just all a big mess.","School pressure I am currently doing A-levels and I am in my final year, in year 13.

"Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.","To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week. First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable. All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad. I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this. Edit Thank you for the support everyone.

First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable. All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad. I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this. Edit Thank you for the support everyone.

I have no passion for anything anymore,"I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I dread waking up and I can’t wait to go home to sleep just so I don’t have to think anymore. I use to have more friends and go out all the time but now all I do is work, see my boyfriend, study and maybe see my friends once a week. My life is so meaningless I feel as if it isint going anywhere and I just feel so empty inside. I use to enjoy activities I use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever I do I can’t enjoy . I don’t know how to get out of this sometimes I can sit for hours just staring at a wall I am so dead inside","I have no passion for anything anymore I don’t enjoy anything anymore.

Uncontrollable Rage Trying To Learn Japanese,"I'm usually quite calm and able to control myself, but trying to learn Katakana through use of Anki has resulted in unbelievable rage. You may think I need to quit learning or it's not something I want to actually do, but I can assure you I do want to learn it quite a lot. The problem is I get so incredibly frustrated when I'm shuffling through the same 20 cards and none of them are sinking in. I have so many leech cards out of rotation it just upsets me. Something else about me is that I don't have the option to write them out like people would suggest. I have had bad wrists for 6 months despite doctors being unable to pinpoint the problem. I meditate every day, sometimes twice a day to keep my stress down and hopefully heal my body. What gets me is that this is the thing that stresses me so much. I don't know why this particular thing makes me want to hurt myself. Like I get so angry I have smashed the computer desk like a child. I'm not a violent person, I've never hit anyone in my life, but sometimes I'm hitting myself or hurting my hands in rage. I grip my hands so hard it starts to hurt. I start hitting myself getting upset because I'm so mad. What should I do about this? Should I stop learning Japanese? I try to keep my expectations low and tell myself it's okay, but some nights I'll miss ones I should know so it gets me so down I'm not actually learning I'm just getting lucky and nothing feels earned at all.","Uncontrollable Rage Trying To Learn Japanese I'm usually quite calm and able to control myself, but trying to learn Katakana through use of Anki has resulted in unbelievable rage.

"Despite all downfalls and against everything, I couldn't be happier with how things are going. Happy with myself and how lucky I am to date the man of my dreams )","Super new to reddit, but in all honesty I read this reddit as often as I do my religious studies and after seeing everyone share their joy never fails to make me smile. So I want to share mine as well -) btw, I'm not a native English. So if sentences don't make sense, you now know why I have known my now boyfriend ever since we were in middle school. He met me during one of the hardest times of my life as a kid. I found out I'm incurably ill at a very young age. Not something that will be fatal on long term but quality of life is severely reduced. As kids his company was one I enjoyed alot, everytime. In all my years of meeting people I've never consistently been able to enjoy someone's presence. Years pass, we change. I did not for the better for a long time. Stuff got to me and I got bitter. (Which, til this day I wish I realised how down bad I was. I'm still thinking about how I could've been better) however, we remained friends but through my act I made him feel not loved with my rough attitude. One day I realised just how poorly I was doing and treating those around me because I got so bitter after alot of things happened. I realised I didn't want to be like this anymore and lost myself over the years. I distanced myself from every thing. Stopped using my phone, computer and consoles as a whole as I started to do some self reflection and learn. Alot of times passes, I wrote down his info to pick up contact again after I bettered myself before I took a trip. I promised him that when I'm ready I would soon greet him again. Going back to people I once knew was harder than ever, all I thought of was how people perceived me and how I was like before I saw in how I was. I struggled contacting him but after months of contemplating I did it. And I couldn't call him. That man singlehandedly changed his phone number dammit! So after contacting some other people who knew both of us they gave me his new info. I messaged him scared whether he would accept me or not and to my suprise, he did. I explained to him everything that went on in my mind and how I look back on myself. From that point on things improved even beyond what I thought. Being around him has made me learn even more. And eventually I felt things were getting a bit awkward. In a pinch and desperate effort I told him that I liked him alot and just needed to get it off my chest because the awkwardness that I felt. I would be fine if he didn't feel the same I knew what risk I would take because if he didn't feel the same at all, well, we all know where that can go. And he said he liked me back and that he always did ever since we were young. I don't know how to transition from this point on in my writing, but life has been so good. We can talk about things, I can be myself even if I am rather childish he always loves seeing me happy and doing what I want to do. He appreciates the transparency of our relationship and that we can talk about every little thing that bothers us and it's okay, we respect eachother and don't mock eachother we listen to each others feelings and improve from that point on. Even if he has odd passions I love them. Seeing his interest and pure joy he finds in a hobby I can't help but smile. I've had some confrontations with people who hate my guts. Rightfully so, it's okay that they're mad and I understand. It motivates me even more to better myself. I've been invested in my roots, languages and beliefs. My health has hit a downfall and I can't do much anymore, I no longer work and had to take care of myself. He's here to support me through it. The path to recovery and getting my health back together will take a long ass time, but hey, atleast I'm with a guy who told me he thought he was going to marry me when we were 10 ) The biggest lessons I've learned and I hope someone can learn from these as well. Respect and equal treatment is important. You never know what someone is going through so never snap at someone because you have your own bad day. Consistent effort and showing you care builds long term bonds, it's okay to be tired but be sure to talk about how you feel and those who really appreciate you will understand how you feel. And last but not least, perception. Do not work yourself up over something someone said if someone comes off rude, I guarantee most of the time someone just worded it poorly. And even if it was meant to hurt you teaching yourself how to perceive the world and things around you will make even such things won't affect you anymore, you'll feel more joy and your quality of life will significantly increase when you start to smile at strangers and see everything in a positive light. The moment you start doing it it becomes natural and will only become a better and more dominant trait over time. Oh and, do it for yourself. Make changes you want to change like investing in a subculture that's not 'socially desirable' but you've always admired. Investing and developing interests will make you feel more confident. I play drums but also love knitting sweaters and I'm proud of these drastically different hobbies. oh and, really the last one. Tell them that you like them. Trust me on that one Sorry I treated this like a diary entry but maybe someone enjoys reading it haha, I still suck at writing. A last reminder for those who need it, know that you're loved. Surround yourself with people who MAKE you feel loved and do not feel afraid to leave and start over again and you can finally start fresh. It helps.

"Mind is racing and I can't stop over thinking everything, feeling in despair about everyone and everything.","I've been unemployed for a year after working in a highly stressful job and at the same time coming to terms that I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression in the midst of it all and figuring out I've had it since I was 13 but never acknowledged or understood why I felt like a outsider 247. I tend to push people I care about away when I want time to myself even though I hate the distance, I don't mean to but I do because I over think everything and my anxiety creates things that aren't even there then it manifests into something that is on loop until I just keep sinking and on top of that the depression really just sends me to such a irrational, overly emotional and unstable person that can't contain my thoughts and I just completely spiral till I feel so hopeless that I just lay there and cry in frustration. This week has really been tough and I don't know who to invest in, my best friend who knows about my depression is always there for me but he has found some new friends which I think has triggered me to believe that just like some of my other friends he will just forget about me and decide its all too hard, I think that's what I fear because then I will be completely alone and it's like losing the light in this dark room that keeps me a float.

Low threshold for stress,"Hello, people. So I've noticed this interesting thing only recently- I don't know how it is for other people but I seem to be disturbed or stressed very easily by various things. What do I mean by that? Let's say I'm laying in my bed relaxing and my relative opens a door of another room, I immediately fall into this ""shock mode for a second"", my all attention is on that sound and I become sooo aware of that, there's no more relaxation. Another thing- I could be relaxing and random noise from... Idk, anywhere happen and then I'm all awake, disturbed, tense. So I basically want to ask you- these forms of stress, are they normal? Or is it a sign of something going on? Because I never paid attention to that but as I got more aware of myself because of different practices and teachings, I've started noticing that when I meditate, let's say, a random noise outside can disrupt that more relaxed state and bring me to full awareness/stress mode even when I'm in a safe environment (my home).

This may be one of the best days of my life,"Just a normal day of doing house chores, teaching my nephew, driving my sister to work.. And when I got home, I received an email. For nearly a year, I've been waiting for this internship in an aviation company. Due to covid, my internship got postponed. I thought they ignored my application or whatever.. But today, I received an email saying I'm gonna start my internship next week!!! I jumped out of joy and excitement first thing when I read it I'm just so happy!!!! Thinking about chances/coincidences, this is the perfect time to get out of my house because I recently got vaccinated. And thinking about the stuff I did during the pandemic, I learned a lot about myself and about the things I thought I'd never like, and I got to help (a lot) in our house, especially helping my nephew who has autism. I remembered the times when I had breakdowns, pandemic anxiety creeping in. Asking myself why are these bad things happening to me. I encountered a lot of problems especially with my family, but thing got better and I did (still do) my best to understand things from their point of view. Looking back, I was a person made out of worry. I worried and overthought everything, which led me to anxiety and breakdowns. With the help of the people around me, especially my boyfriend who's my number 1 supporter, I learned a lot about prioritizing better things in my life and not worrying too much. And this day is a very good example of the quote in the picture.

"Do you experience depression"" question at the doctor's office","I went to the doctor for an annual checkup recently and one of the first questions the nurse asked in the initial screening in the exam room was something like ""Do you experience depression?"" I wanted to answer honestly because I do a lot of the time after some of the turns my life has taken, so I said ""Yes."" Then the nurse looked at me and prompted me to take my answer back and change it to ""No"" by telling me that if I say ""Yes"" that means like suicidal and I guess would be something they'd have to report. The fact is, I do think about suicide. I mean I've never acted on it, but it's not like the thoughts don't cross my mind. I just don't understand how we draw this firm, clear line between ""normal"" people and ""depressed"" people, and then if you outwardly manage your depression well enough, they look at you like you're crazy for saying you are depressed. Even worse is that some caring, well-meaning person probably had the question added to the triage process in the first place, but then in actual practice the person asking the questions pushes you to not answer the question honestly. What is the point of even asking the question if you are just going to push people that experience depression and manage it the best they can to lie and say they don't? I think my depression likely does have actual negative consequences for my overall health too that might be relevant to the medical exam.

I just don't understand how we draw this firm, clear line between ""normal"" people and ""depressed"" people, and then if you outwardly manage your depression well enough, they look at you like you're crazy for saying you are depressed. Even worse is that some caring, well-meaning person probably had the question added to the triage process in the first place, but then in actual practice the person asking the questions pushes you to not answer the question honestly. What is the point of even asking the question if you are just going to push people that experience depression and manage it the best they can to lie and say they don't? I think my depression likely does have actual negative consequences for my overall health too that might be relevant to the medical exam. Thoughts?",1
I almost killed myself today,"I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything. Before I could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. He pressed his face to mine and I just snapped back. I’m trying so hard to get better. I’m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me. Edit I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management. To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn’t be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I’m a failure. You don’t have to tell me that. I know but I’ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life.","I almost killed myself today I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out.

Feeling I need to vent about life in general,"I just feel like I need to vent. I'm 31 and currently living with my narc mom. After covid hit I lost my job and out of desperation made the choice to move back. I have both an autoimmune disorder (lupus) and currently dealing with major depression. The combination of the two means that I deal with lots of fatigue, and that a lot of times I don't really strongly feel like doing much of anything, though I do force myself to get outside and I'm functional enough to I take care of the basic needs like daily hygiene and buying and making food for myself. Recently it has just been feeling very oppressive. I'm in sort of a paradoxical position where I wish I wasn't all alone all the time (I don't really have any local friends) yet the depression keeps me from wanting to go and hang out with people. I have anhedonia which means I don't really feel positive emotions such as joy and love, but I am able to feel negative emotions such as frustration, hurt, and anger. I struggle with self hate and when its at its worst I feel like I hate almost everyone. I've been living in the same small town city now for about 15 years. I know it wouldn't cure my depression but honestly a lot of times I wish I could just see different scenery. I'm currently working on my master's in teaching, when I first started out I felt on top of the world, and then right after my first semester the major depression hit after a mental breakdown. Being on medication has helped and I've been able to get better since the initial breakdown, but now I'm left worrying how am I going to have the motivation to make it through the rest of the program. I'm tired and sometimes all I want to do is just sleep.","Feeling I need to vent about life in general I just feel like I need to vent. I'm 31 and currently living with my narc mom.

Why do I crash so hard after having dare I say a good day,"This is why I dont trust feeling good anymore man. Like, the better of a day I have at work and how good I feel (which is honestly rare), the worse off i am after it. Today was fuckin chill. I got shit done, I was moving, I was working good and as much as I'm scared to actually say it, it was a good day at work. 5 o'clock hits and the INSTANT I walk out that door, it all comes crashing down. The 25 minute drive home was spent staring blankly ahead of me and I barely remembered the drive once I pulled in my driveway. And once my ass hit the couch it was like fuckin game over. I just plummet into this godawful mood like I want to fucking die and wished a semi had hit ice and flattened me earlier. Intrusive, irrational, disgusting thoughts running buck-fuckin-wild with no control. and the instant those are ""appeased"", all that energy turns into self-loathing. I never spend time in my bedroom unless it's to sleep. But I went to lay in bed and I just wanted to cry. Me. Who went 6 years without a single fucking tear and only cried earlier this year cause I got absolutely fucking shitfaced on alcohol and weed. Laying in bed and wanting to cry for no reason, but not being able to because I built it into my system to suppress it and completely shut down emotionally any time there's a feeling like that. this is why I'm scared to ever say ""yea I had a good day"". the fall that immediately comes after is fucking soul-crushing. every time. what the fuck is wrong with me","Why do I crash so hard after having dare I say a good day This is why I dont trust feeling good anymore man.

My friend is being released from the psychiatric hospital tomorrow!,"Almost a month ago, an old friend of mine went through a suicidal breakdown and he called me out of the blue for help after two years of no contact. His family is Hmong and they have very traditional gender roles. He didn’t know who else to talk to, so he just called me. He used to be my best friend in junior college and when he told me everything that was going on, I drove four hours from where I was in the middle of the night to come get him and take him to the ER and his family. This happened the day before my partner and I broke up and she was in a psychiatric hospital herself. My dad was also having some issues with his heart and I had been dealing with my own issues. It was an absurdly tough period. The last time I had seen him in person, something very similar to this had happened and he hadn’t spoke to me once since then until this particular night except to ask for a job reference. The last time he’d been on the edge, I had told him he could always ask me for help and I’d always be there for him. In the moment of as he explained what was going on, it was all I could think about and I decided I was going to do my best to honor that commitment. He ended up being admitted to a local hospital and I’ve stayed in contact with him since. We’ve caught up on a lot and he explained why he cut contact the way he did. The reasons are understandable and things got pretty emotional when he apologized. Thing is, this was my dude when we were in school and no matter how much our friendship ending hurt when it did, being human is an imperfect experience. We fuck up, we make mistakes. I’ve made so many in my life, more than I can count. I’ve come to believe it’s not making mistakes that matters, it’s how you respond and react to them. Resentment and hate are also such chaining and corrupting emotions. There’s so much freedom in forgiveness and I know all too well what it’s like to feel alone. Finally, he is being released tomorrow! I am so freaking excited for him! I am so glad he is still here on this spinning rock, I am so happy he is going to be okay. I’m flying down from Washington later today to spend some time with him. I’ve been living through the most insane periods of my life and this one of the silver linings of it all. More than anything, I’m just glad that when he called, as piss poor as the timing was, that I was able to just help and that I have my friend back again. So often I’m on the road for work and I would’ve been too far away to really be of any assistance. I don’t know how I would’ve responded had something else had happened. I’ve seen too many people in my life for young in the past few years.","My friend is being released from the psychiatric hospital tomorrow!

I was confident for once and it paid off,"I (15F) went with my mom and brother to pick up food today, our cashier was one of the coolest looking people I've ever seen. They had short black hair, that was dyed blue at the tips, so when they turned around the blue shined. They had black winged eyeliner and had multiple piercings through their ears, and dark silver necklaces. Something about them just exhibited 'cool' without them really trying. I really really wanted to tell them that I liked their hair. I've been an introvert for a long time, and my anxiety is at its peak right now, but today I went 'f it' and I told them I thought their hair was cool. They were very nice too. Even if they don't care, or forget, which they probably will and that's what I except, as long as I could do something to make their day just a -little- bit better, I would do it again. For now, I'm just feeling happy.","I was confident for once and it paid off I (15F) went with my mom and brother to pick up food today, our cashier was one of the coolest looking people I've ever seen.

Looking for advice - worried about SO's health,"Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons. I'm (m30) really worried about my SO's (f29) health and could really do with some advice. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom. I'm not sure if any of this content may be triggering, so I apologise if it is. Some context - we have been together nearly 10 years; lived together for 6. Before that, we did long distance for 2 years. Long distance was hard, and during that time my SO was going through what she calls a ""hypochondriac stage"", in which she was always worrying about her health and scared she was going to get ill. After we moved in together, that worry subsided and things were ok. I suffer from mild anxiety too, so we both had our bouts every now and then, but great other than that. She would always think very low of herself though, especially her appearance and her weight. Whenever we went anywhere, 9/10 times she would have a break down about what she would be wearing, which often made us late or led to an argument or general stress. Fast forward a few years. Just before Covid, she suffered the loss her step mother, who wasn't even 50. This was obviously devastating, but did lead to her and her dad becoming closer. Then Covid hit, and as such she has never fully had time to grieve for her step mum. On top of that, in June, her dad announced that he had met someone else. In November, he said they were moving in together. Two weeks ago, he announced they were getting married. The way that he announced all of these was either very nonchalantly (over Zoom/phone call) or in a very grandiose way, expecting congratulations I'm sure. Obviously, my SO (and her sister) are appalled, and her dad doesn't quite seem to understand why. On top of that, he is so wrapped up in his own life, that he isn't taking the time to ask how my SO/her sister are feeling about. It's very messed up, and I'm furious at him. So that's two reasons why she is feeling particularly stressed at the moment. The third is work. We are both key workers, and as such have been going into work throughout the last year when others were WFH. On top of that, her work has been insanely busy and she is working on average 11 hour days, and the work still isn't done. The team she manages are not pulling their weight and management, from what I can gather, seem quite useless and keep promising solutions but never deliver. She doesn't want to quit, mainly because finding a job in this uncertain climate will be stressful too, and in the somewhat likely event that redundancies are made, it'll probably be a first in, first out situation. Her day of anxiousness usually goes as follows - Wake up feeling stressed about work and about what to wear - will sometimes have a break down. At work, overloaded with workload - will go to the bathroom to cry. In the evening, will come home stressed after a bad day. At night, will worry about sleeping and as a result will often have a big break down if she can't sleep/gets woken up. ​ These break downs range from having trouble breathing to hurting herself - thankfully never seriously, but she has given herself scratches and bruises etc. Additionally, there are certain words that might trigger her, like if I mention anything about breathing, her chest goes tight. Or if I suggest we go to bed earlier, she becomes panicked about sleeping. I have suggested apps such as Headspace but she says they don't work, and she doesn't want to go on medication. I'm really worried about her, and feel awful that I don't really know how to help. I'm worried that one day she is going to badly hurt herself (she has never expressed anything about being suicidal, so I'm not worried about that - more just badly hurting), and also worried that, quite frankly, she could give herself a heart attack or something. It's also obviously having an effect on me, as every evening I'm on edge, not wanting to trigger a reaction in anyway, and feel absolutely rotten if I do. But, admittedly, the whole situation also makes me feel very angry. Not necessarily at her, but just like...why is this happening? I hope that makes sense and doesn't make me sound like an asshole. I'm just at a loss with what to do. I love her more than anything and am just so worried about her, so any advice could be greatly appreciated, thank you! tl;dr - SO is having panic attacks nearly every night and day, is extremely stressed, and I'm worried about her heatlh.","Looking for advice - worried about SO's health Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

Losing my house but I’m going to be okay,"Dear kind souls of Reddit, I am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now , but I am going to be okay. I would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way. I bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016. I got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and I got house insurance and title insurance. After I moved in, I began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter. I have spent around $4,000 in repairs over the past two years and I think I have finally solved the problem. My sewer stopped working properly in March of this year and I have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem. The plumber and I put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street. I ended up having to dig up my driveway, break the sewer and put the camera through....only to find that the sewer is clean. The sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it. In order to fix the broken pipe, the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there, and in order to do this, I will have to completely remove my house, fix the sewer, and then put my house back on my property. The total bill for this will be around $10,000 and it is at the point where I am ready to just get a new house. I will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house, but I don’t really have many options. I would not have bought this house if I had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance won’t cover any of this. I have proof that the previous owners knew about the water line freezing, but I have no proof that they knew anything about the sewer freezing. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for several months, I am under so much stress, and I am furious. I have been living in a hotel since March while I am still stuck paying a mortgage on property tax on a house that I can’t live in. Why does the world work this way?","Losing my house but I’m going to be okay Dear kind souls of Reddit, I am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now , but I am going to be okay.

kinda?) finally getting the thai teenager experience.,"ummm so I'm not sure what to put in the title because it's kinda complicated but I guess what I said works. just a warning that this gonna be a long post also lol. lately i've been making so many new friends. local friends!! i didn't have a lot of local friends previously (people from my country) as i has to cut off people from my old school, and now i am not inside my country's education system either. most of my friends are overseas, my bestfriends are almost 13,000 miles away. i've always wanted to have people i could go hangout with. people with the same timezone to hangout with. people to talk about shit going on here, not ones that i am just explaining the whole situation to, but one that shares an experience. i've first met this friend through a facebook group. i had a post that went viral and he added me. he then commissioned my art. i then found out we're the same age and like a lot of things in common. i was really happy to have a new local friend. he also let me send him happy mail and i made him a rick roll card!! then i joined his discord server and got to meet his classmates. his friends are really nice to me so we soon became friends too. i send them happy mail. i help them cheat on their online exams and their english homework. we have now talked about maybe hanging out at the amusement park when covid gets better. my friend says that i'm like the unofficial 46th student of their class because of how much I interact with everyone. i feel so accepted. its so nice. then i met my friend's other friend. it was actually just a day ago. we hung out and talked on call and it was so fun!! i asked if i could send him mail too and he was really enthusiastic. and told me i can send as much as i want and he will keep a collection. then this new friend introduced me to his gf and shes likes stationery!! she was so excited when i told her i do snail mail. she said she had never done it before and would love to write with me. i was really scared that i would somehow not be able to hangout with these people because of what happened in the past. but now im literally doing nothing but being myself and i am making so many friends!!! i just feel so fucking happy rn. i am making so many new friends. i will get to use thai language more. i could probably even HANGOUT with them in MY COUNTRY now!!! they actually all live in a different province from me, so it's not like i can see them all the time, but it's not super difficult to meet them either. IM SO EXCITED. I FEEL LIKE I AM FINALLY GETTING THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE A LIFE OF A TEENAGER IN THAILAND. I thought I wouldn't have a chance as I'm about to not be a teenage very soon. I have voice calls and video calls to be in all day. Like I've always dreamed of. People are enthusiastic at what I do and I don't have to only care about what they like. It makes me feel so fucking full inside I'm bursting with joy. I know this post was quite long and I maybe didn't even make that much sense but thank you so much for listening to me!! Also, if anyone wants to know what happened about my old friends I can tell you. But only via a letter lol.

"I need help, I don't know what to do","This is a throwaway account. I'm utterly embarrassed with myself. I'm young and have so much I feel like I can accomplish. I'm sitting here at work, writing this, and currently having on of the worst days of my life. I feel alone. I feel unable to connect. I am isolated. I feel like nobody understands. I don't blame anyone for not understand. Maybe I'm wrong. I just want to feel better, to feel connected. I want to care about something other than myself. I don't even know where to begin. I am in a position where I believe there is so much negativity in my life, it effects my internal optimism. the real me is so much different than me. I don't know how to explain that. I don't know if others feel that way too. Theres the 'you' who tries to be compassionate, and caring. But then deep down, there's a different you. I have such a hard time expressing myself because I feel like nobody cares how others feel. You know why I feel like this. I don't care how others feel, well I Kinda do. Let me put it like this. Let's say there is a guy I know called bob. He tells me about his problems, and how hard is life is. I tell him that really sucks, and I understand what I'm going through. And suddenly he feels better, now that he's had someone to vent to. But the reason I'm trying to comfort him is not because I care about his issues, I don't understand the pain he is going through. The reason I comfort him is because I understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving. It makes you feel like your not the only one going through that. But what if that's just what everyone does. That's how i feel about venting. Even though I'm sitting here typing to you, you probably don't care. And even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting, it's not. I don't believe you, I can't honestly believe that, the person you're talking to, that you actually care for that person. I don't know if that's true or not, but my deep down me say's it is true. I've contemplated several reasonings to why I feel so.... I don't know how to describe it. I don't trust anyone but myself. I cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words. When I was growing up, I had terrible parents. No they didn't hit me, or physically abuse me. They didn't play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about. So why do I say there were terrible parents. They weren't there. They were, but they weren't. All I ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed. I remember my dad sitting in his room watching T.V. We never went out. We never vacationed. I don't feel like I know those people. I feel isolated. Once I reached high school things changed a bit. My parent's split to no surprise from anyone. My dad and I lived together and got somewhat closer. I wanted to live with my mom, but my sister did too. And I didn't want my dad to have to live alone. My dad was going through a deep depression at the time. We would both stay home at night. We didn't do anything. I got the new COD black ops. I start skipping school. Nothing feels good, nothing feels right. I just want to play video games, it's the only thing that takes me away. it's the only thing I look forward too. I start skipping more. I never make it to class after lunch anymore. Principal calls my dad to setup a meeting. I've missed over 80 days of school. I'm not going to be a freshman next year. I used to be a straight A student in middle school. I still think I could be. I go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues. Still skipping school. I know it's not the right thing to do, but I hurt. I don't care, I want to escape. We move across the country for a new start. My dad and I move in with his mother. My grandpa recently passed, so she was quite lonely. Also, my dad is a mama's boy for sure, so this helped him out too. I went to a new school, had a new start. I meet somebody the first of day. she came up to me and started talking. this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that. I feel different. I feel confident. Maybe people do like me. Turns out we go to the same church, we're in the same ward, the same classes. She is amazing. I meet another guy, he's so cool. He's extremely outgoing and we also go the same church, the same school, have some of the same classes. Both of them start dating. I am absolutely crushed. I feel alone, I thought i found some people I could connect with, but then puppy love takes over and once again I'm ignored. I meet her best friend. She's kind of cute, and she really likes me. Ok what the hell let's give it a shot. We start dating, i think i like her. Let's makeout, and hangout. We should have sex, sex is so cool. Oh you don't want to? that's okay we can just start slow. Everytime she comes over it's the same thing, puppy love. She starts to take notice that the relationship is very one-sided. I'm oblivious. I want sex, I want attention, I want to feel normal. But I can't take this stress she is causing me. We're over, I'm done with you. I don't feel bad about it. Then my two new friend that were together break up. I don't want to step on my friends toes so I don't make any moves. But she's amazing, I actually care for her. We start hanging out everday when they breakup. I want to be with her. I feel like at times she feels the same, but at other times there's nothing. She starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me. She is relieving stress and I don't care, i just want to be there with her. Things escalate, we get very close, i feel like i can tell her anything. Things heat up sexually, we constantly tease each other. Then she got a job and everything changed. She met a guy. We weren't official or anything but i thought we were close. I just don't know how to express how I feel to her, and i feel like i'm a backup to her. Maybe i was, maybe i wasn't. She start's dating this new guy. He's a bad influence, he smokes and drinks, and he's been to jail. But the thing is care for her, and I don't want to stand in the way of them being together. So we revert back to friends. There's no issue between us three, they let me hang out with them whenever. The guy likes me, we smoke together. One night they were at a park drinking. They wanted to go home, and he got in his truck. He hit someone, they were instantly killed. He's running from police, She gets out of the car. He crashes into a park. I can't believe it. She's pregnant. I can't deal with this. A girl I work with tells me about a stoner friend she has. She thinks we would like each other. The three of us decided to hang out that night. Everything goes real smoothly, I genuinely enjoy this girls company. The three of us go to my house and watch some movies, I get her friends number. I invite her to hangout that night again. She sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night. We're hanging out and she makes a move. Things escalate and next thing I know my virginity is gone. It is clear she had already lost hers. Our relationship quickly turns sexual, she want's to fuck all the time. I'm not looking for sexual relationship deep down, but the cool me (that I want everyone to know and like) does want to fuck. It's cool, it's what happy people do. This is a normal relationship. We get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend. He hates me, I'm a bad influence on her. We keep seeing each other, I start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship. Her parent's aren't home and I go to see her. She has to meet up with them in a few hours, and they won't be coming home until after that meetup. Uh oh, someone just came home, quick hide next to my bed. I have to leave right now, don't worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too, just leave after they leave. So there I lay, waiting for them to leave. Suddenly the door opens, it's the boyfriend. He checks the room and finds me. He doesn't let me leave, he say's I'm trespassing. I tell him I was invited in and told to hide there. He doesn't believe me, he doesn't let me pass. I try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops. This is bullshit. I push through him and run downstairs to leave. Fuck her, I can't believe she put me through that. She should've taken the heat. I start developing anxiety from that experience. I've never had anxiety. I didn't know anxiety existed until that point. I never want to hear from her again, but i really liked her. I need to get out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this town. I'm tired of it. I want to move back to where I came from, at least I know area. And hey, weed is legal there so at least I got something that will help me. So I tell everyone that I'm leaving, nobody tries to stop me. I have $300 in savings and plane ticket. I have no where to stay. I just know I want to leave. I'm saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down. We're half brothers, and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me. I didn't know this at the time, but he's running from the cops. He was a warrant out in our home state. He waits outside my house at the park next door till I wakeup to tell me that he's here. Someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool. He was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing. The cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me. I learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park. Those fucking racist neighbors, just because he's black doesn't mean he's homeless. I talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first, because I didn't want to identify myself, I was scared. The cop harasses both us, one of us is lying, but we committed no real crime so he let's us go. I say hey let's go smoke some weed with my friend. So I drive his car over to my friends house and we light up. Then we decided to go to my other friends house. So we leave my friends neighborhood. We're being followed, but i didn't realize this at the time. We get to a three way intersection, I take a right and pull into the second lane because I have to take an immediate left after. I pull over to next to the side walk and park. I start unbuckling and next thing I know there is a cop next to my window. He yells at me to roll down the window. The window doesn't work. I try to yell this through the door, he tells me to open the door. I comply, I am literally shaking. We have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud. I'm scared. He says he smells marijauna as soon as I open the door. Bullshit, he's lying. The bud is in a mason jar, and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it. He takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me. I know you have weed in there, so just let me know where it is and this will all be over. We don't mind calling the K-9 unites to search your car, and we probably won't stop them if they try to bite you in the ass. I tell them where everything is, I was scared. They start harassing my brother. ""We don't want your kind in this city. Leave and do not come back"". He is black, is that the kind your talking about? are you fucking kidding me right now? do you fucking hear yourself? We're taken into custody and driven to the police station, they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were. No we weren't doing anything wrong, you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city. You harassed us and assumed we had weed on us, despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood. Doesn't matter, I have a plane ticket and I'm already leaving. I arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact I reached out to earlier. We're in similar positions, he's a year older just moved to Chicago. He's very forward about the fact that he is homosexual.we'll call him bradley. Okay no problem. I figure he realizes I'm not interested. He offers me a place to stay with im for $300. Perfect, that's all I have. I get a job at a local pizza place, it's perfect cause I can make tips to help me until next paycheck. Now I have no money. Turns out it's not his house, but we're sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago. the other people are great, but they hate bradley. bradley is a douche. bradley suggest I might be a closet homosexual. He will have sex with me if I want, but he let's me know he would be the top. He tells other people that I'm actually a 32 year old pretending to be 19. He tells other people I'm hiding my homosexuality. He constantly describes homo sex to me. I don't want to hear about it. I tell him I don't care who he likes, what gender he is, I don't want to hear about his sex life. He continues to harass me sexually. I ask the other roommates if I can take the extra room upstairs, I'll pay for a fair share of the rent. They all hate bradley and they agree. It's a shitty house, and I want to move out. I want to move closer to work. I isolate myself further, all these new people, this is a new life. I'm on my own now. Nobody is going to help me. I find a roommate and we get a small apt to share. I quit the pizza place after some bullshit that I'm over with. Bad management that blames the staff for everything. Just one example there was a busy Wednesday night where I was the only server. The ice cream machine breaks and I'm usually the one to fix it. I don't have time as I am serving everyone. I'm supposed to clean it every night. We usually have two servers on a busy night like this. I finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point it's midnight. I have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush. I'm exhausted from covering another server's shift. I put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on, as it is broken. Skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasn't cleaned properly last night, and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? CAN YOU FUCKING READ???? I come in to see the damage and I see the note still on the ice cream machine. He say's he saw the note, but doesn't tell me anything more than that. He didn't tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note. He yells at me for not staying later than I did even though I already worked an hour and a half past my get off time, while working two fucking shifts. Long story short, his wife told me she didn't have time to fix my paycheck with 10 overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck. fuck you bitch, you don't deserve me as an employee and I walk out. I then find the job opportunity of my life, a web design firm is hiring. Okay awesome, let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills. I walk in to the interview, everything is brand new, everyone is dressed super nice, everyone is super young. I start and 3 days after being hired, my supervisor is fired for nodding out. I should've seen this sign and left right then and there. The owner starts talking to me more and more. He gives me special jobs, and has talks with me all the time. It's clear he is doing some sort of drugs. Over the next few months, and many raises later things start going really downhill. This guy starts playing mind games with everyone. Someone is stealing is leads. Someone is always out to get him. He want's to know who is stabbing him in the back. He set's up elaborate traps to catch people in the act. He ends up accusing me of stealing leads. That's impossible, I would never do that. He set's it up so that I end up blaming another one of his top guys. But if you look at all the evidence HE PLANTED, he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads. So then he accuses me because of the accusations I made about his TOP guy. This is some bullshit. He calls me that night because he want's me to admit to it. I go off him, I've never felt so betrayed in my life, I told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him. He just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy. He say's it's gonna be ok, and he forgives me. He just want's me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over. NO FUCK YOU, it wasn't me. go fuck yourself. He contacts me the next day when I don't show up for work. He says come hangout with me, I just want to talk. We go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account. Everything is going fine, I'm explaining to him how betrayed i felt. He apologizes and says it won't happen again. Then he decides he will take me home. He pulls over the side of the road on the way home, and crushes what appears to be 2 30mg percs, and 2 lines of cocoa. Snorts that shit right up. on the side of the fucking road. I feel unsafe, I want to leave this company, never see this guy again. And I do leave, fuck this industry. I want to make my own company. And what do you know, I isolate myself deeper. I can't trust anybody, they will just end up fucking you. I get 3 other friends together as business partners. The only way I can describe the next 6 months, is us 'pretending' to be a company. It's like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends. We had meetings, and sale pitches, and presentations to potential clients, but we never actually did any 'real' nitty gritty work. We played company for six months, took in over $40k and spent all of it. Every customer charged back on us for not doing anything, and that company went bankrupt very quickly. At this point I had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive. So now I was slightly in debt, with no job. Only thing to do is to start my own company. MY OWN. I'm the boss. I take everything i learned from my previous experiences. I rely on already established relationships for work. I get enough freelance work to support myself and the company. I'm working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat. It's worth it to me. I don't want anyone taking advantage of me. I'm done with the bullshit. I'm done with people fucking me. I'm done. So how does this all affect me now? Why do I feel more lost than I ever have been? You know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject. It's when they realize that no matter how much they study, and learn. They'll never learn everything about the subject. That realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject. Maybe that's how I feel about life at this point. I'll never truly get the point I want to be at, and the reason I know that is from all the past experiences I've had. I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm stressed. I'm alone. I don't know how to connect with anyone. I don't trust anyone. I'm alone. I'm isolated. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. Nobody in my life at the moment is my age. There is nobody I can come home to. No friends or girlfriends. Nothing. I'm Alone. I work more hours than I want to. I'm dying. I didn't take care of my teeth as an adolescent. My teeth are practically falling out. I have three molars that have practically decayed, but i don't have enough money to do anything about it. I'm still recovering from the debt I have accrued. My car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it. I literally haven't even paid off my last car bill.cost me $700, which put me into debt again. Now I need to pay around another $1000 just get it drive-able again. There is nobody to tell this too. Nobody is willing to help me. I'm going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business. I'm fucked. I got fucked. I'm absolutely alone. If you have read this far, I want you to know I'm not asking for money here. Please don't offer. I'm not here for monetary gain. I don't know what I'm here for. I'm sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now. I wish I could just hug someone right now. anybody. I wish I could feel some level of comfort when all I want to do is to lay down and cry. And as I write what I determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation, tears are slowly rolling down my eyes. I don't think I can press submit, but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me. I don't feel like there is anybody I could tell all of this too, which is why I'm writing this right now. I don't want anybody to try and help, I don't know if I can press submit now. It makes me feel like a burden. I don't want to be a burden. I'm just going to do it. Maybe somebody out there can shed some light for me. ","I need help, I don't know what to do This is a throwaway account. I'm utterly embarrassed with myself. I'm young and have so much I feel like I can accomplish. I'm sitting here at work, writing this, and currently having on of the worst days of my life. I feel alone. I feel unable to connect.

Ok what the hell let's give it a shot. We start dating, i think i like her. Let's makeout, and hangout. We should have sex, sex is so cool. Oh you don't want to? that's okay we can just start slow. Everytime she comes over it's the same thing, puppy love. She starts to take notice that the relationship is very one-sided. I'm oblivious. I want sex, I want attention, I want to feel normal. But I can't take this stress she is causing me. We're over, I'm done with you. I don't feel bad about it. Then my two new friend that were together break up. I don't want to step on my friends toes so I don't make any moves. But she's amazing, I actually care for her. We start hanging out everday when they breakup. I want to be with her. I feel like at times she feels the same, but at other times there's nothing. She starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me. She is relieving stress and I don't care, i just want to be there with her. Things escalate, we get very close, i feel like i can tell her anything. Things heat up sexually, we constantly tease each other. Then she got a job and everything changed. She met a guy. We weren't official or anything but i thought we were close. I just don't know how to express how I feel to her, and i feel like i'm a backup to her. Maybe i was, maybe i wasn't. She start's dating this new guy. He's a bad influence, he smokes and drinks, and he's been to jail. But the thing is care for her, and I don't want to stand in the way of them being together. So we revert back to friends. There's no issue between us three, they let me hang out with them whenever. The guy likes me, we smoke together. One night they were at a park drinking. They wanted to go home, and he got in his truck. He hit someone, they were instantly killed. He's running from police, She gets out of the car. He crashes into a park. I can't believe it. She's pregnant. I can't deal with this. A girl I work with tells me about a stoner friend she has. She thinks we would like each other. The three of us decided to hang out that night. Everything goes real smoothly, I genuinely enjoy this girls company. The three of us go to my house and watch some movies, I get her friends number. I invite her to hangout that night again. She sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night. We're hanging out and she makes a move. Things escalate and next thing I know my virginity is gone. It is clear she had already lost hers. Our relationship quickly turns sexual, she want's to fuck all the time. I'm not looking for sexual relationship deep down, but the cool me (that I want everyone to know and like) does want to fuck. It's cool, it's what happy people do. This is a normal relationship. We get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend. He hates me, I'm a bad influence on her. We keep seeing each other, I start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship. Her parent's aren't home and I go to see her. She has to meet up with them in a few hours, and they won't be coming home until after that meetup. Uh oh, someone just came home, quick hide next to my bed. I have to leave right now, don't worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too, just leave after they leave. So there I lay, waiting for them to leave. Suddenly the door opens, it's the boyfriend. He checks the room and finds me. He doesn't let me leave, he say's I'm trespassing. I tell him I was invited in and told to hide there. He doesn't believe me, he doesn't let me pass. I try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops. This is bullshit. I push through him and run downstairs to leave. Fuck her, I can't believe she put me through that. She should've taken the heat. I start developing anxiety from that experience. I've never had anxiety. I didn't know anxiety existed until that point. I never want to hear from her again, but i really liked her. I need to get out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this town. I'm tired of it. I want to move back to where I came from, at least I know area. And hey, weed is legal there so at least I got something that will help me. So I tell everyone that I'm leaving, nobody tries to stop me. I have $300 in savings and plane ticket. I have no where to stay. I just know I want to leave. I'm saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down. We're half brothers, and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me. I didn't know this at the time, but he's running from the cops. He was a warrant out in our home state. He waits outside my house at the park next door till I wakeup to tell me that he's here. Someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool. He was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing. The cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me. I learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park. Those fucking racist neighbors, just because he's black doesn't mean he's homeless. I talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first, because I didn't want to identify myself, I was scared. The cop harasses both us, one of us is lying, but we committed no real crime so he let's us go. I say hey let's go smoke some weed with my friend. So I drive his car over to my friends house and we light up. Then we decided to go to my other friends house. So we leave my friends neighborhood. We're being followed, but i didn't realize this at the time. We get to a three way intersection, I take a right and pull into the second lane because I have to take an immediate left after. I pull over to next to the side walk and park. I start unbuckling and next thing I know there is a cop next to my window. He yells at me to roll down the window. The window doesn't work. I try to yell this through the door, he tells me to open the door. I comply, I am literally shaking. We have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud. I'm scared. He says he smells marijauna as soon as I open the door. Bullshit, he's lying. The bud is in a mason jar, and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it. He takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me. I know you have weed in there, so just let me know where it is and this will all be over. We don't mind calling the K-9 unites to search your car, and we probably won't stop them if they try to bite you in the ass. I tell them where everything is, I was scared. They start harassing my brother. ""We don't want your kind in this city. Leave and do not come back"". He is black, is that the kind your talking about? are you fucking kidding me right now? do you fucking hear yourself? We're taken into custody and driven to the police station, they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were. No we weren't doing anything wrong, you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city. You harassed us and assumed we had weed on us, despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood. Doesn't matter, I have a plane ticket and I'm already leaving. I arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact I reached out to earlier. We're in similar positions, he's a year older just moved to Chicago. He's very forward about the fact that he is homosexual.we'll call him bradley. Okay no problem. I figure he realizes I'm not interested. He offers me a place to stay with im for $300. Perfect, that's all I have. I get a job at a local pizza place, it's perfect cause I can make tips to help me until next paycheck. Now I have no money. Turns out it's not his house, but we're sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago. the other people are great, but they hate bradley. bradley is a douche. bradley suggest I might be a closet homosexual. He will have sex with me if I want, but he let's me know he would be the top. He tells other people that I'm actually a 32 year old pretending to be 19. He tells other people I'm hiding my homosexuality. He constantly describes homo sex to me. I don't want to hear about it. I tell him I don't care who he likes, what gender he is, I don't want to hear about his sex life. He continues to harass me sexually. I ask the other roommates if I can take the extra room upstairs, I'll pay for a fair share of the rent. They all hate bradley and they agree. It's a shitty house, and I want to move out. I want to move closer to work. I isolate myself further, all these new people, this is a new life. I'm on my own now. Nobody is going to help me. I find a roommate and we get a small apt to share. I quit the pizza place after some bullshit that I'm over with. Bad management that blames the staff for everything. Just one example there was a busy Wednesday night where I was the only server. The ice cream machine breaks and I'm usually the one to fix it. I don't have time as I am serving everyone. I'm supposed to clean it every night. We usually have two servers on a busy night like this. I finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point it's midnight. I have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush. I'm exhausted from covering another server's shift. I put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on, as it is broken. Skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasn't cleaned properly last night, and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? CAN YOU FUCKING READ???? I come in to see the damage and I see the note still on the ice cream machine. He say's he saw the note, but doesn't tell me anything more than that. He didn't tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note. He yells at me for not staying later than I did even though I already worked an hour and a half past my get off time, while working two fucking shifts. Long story short, his wife told me she didn't have time to fix my paycheck with 10 overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck. fuck you bitch, you don't deserve me as an employee and I walk out. I then find the job opportunity of my life, a web design firm is hiring. Okay awesome, let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills. I walk in to the interview, everything is brand new, everyone is dressed super nice, everyone is super young. I start and 3 days after being hired, my supervisor is fired for nodding out. I should've seen this sign and left right then and there. The owner starts talking to me more and more. He gives me special jobs, and has talks with me all the time. It's clear he is doing some sort of drugs. Over the next few months, and many raises later things start going really downhill. This guy starts playing mind games with everyone. Someone is stealing is leads. Someone is always out to get him. He want's to know who is stabbing him in the back. He set's up elaborate traps to catch people in the act. He ends up accusing me of stealing leads. That's impossible, I would never do that. He set's it up so that I end up blaming another one of his top guys. But if you look at all the evidence HE PLANTED, he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads. So then he accuses me because of the accusations I made about his TOP guy. This is some bullshit. He calls me that night because he want's me to admit to it. I go off him, I've never felt so betrayed in my life, I told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him. He just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy. He say's it's gonna be ok, and he forgives me. He just want's me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over. NO FUCK YOU, it wasn't me. go fuck yourself. He contacts me the next day when I don't show up for work. He says come hangout with me, I just want to talk. We go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account. Everything is going fine, I'm explaining to him how betrayed i felt. He apologizes and says it won't happen again. Then he decides he will take me home. He pulls over the side of the road on the way home, and crushes what appears to be 2 30mg percs, and 2 lines of cocoa. Snorts that shit right up. on the side of the fucking road. I feel unsafe, I want to leave this company, never see this guy again. And I do leave, fuck this industry. I want to make my own company. And what do you know, I isolate myself deeper. I can't trust anybody, they will just end up fucking you. I get 3 other friends together as business partners. The only way I can describe the next 6 months, is us 'pretending' to be a company. It's like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends. We had meetings, and sale pitches, and presentations to potential clients, but we never actually did any 'real' nitty gritty work. We played company for six months, took in over $40k and spent all of it. Every customer charged back on us for not doing anything, and that company went bankrupt very quickly. At this point I had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive. So now I was slightly in debt, with no job. Only thing to do is to start my own company. MY OWN. I'm the boss. I take everything i learned from my previous experiences. I rely on already established relationships for work. I get enough freelance work to support myself and the company. I'm working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat. It's worth it to me. I don't want anyone taking advantage of me. I'm done with the bullshit. I'm done with people fucking me. I'm done. So how does this all affect me now? Why do I feel more lost than I ever have been? You know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject. It's when they realize that no matter how much they study, and learn. They'll never learn everything about the subject. That realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject. Maybe that's how I feel about life at this point. I'll never truly get the point I want to be at, and the reason I know that is from all the past experiences I've had. I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm stressed. I'm alone. I don't know how to connect with anyone. I don't trust anyone. I'm alone. I'm isolated. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. Nobody in my life at the moment is my age. There is nobody I can come home to. No friends or girlfriends. Nothing. I'm Alone. I work more hours than I want to. I'm dying. I didn't take care of my teeth as an adolescent. My teeth are practically falling out. I have three molars that have practically decayed, but i don't have enough money to do anything about it. I'm still recovering from the debt I have accrued. My car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it. I literally haven't even paid off my last car bill.cost me $700, which put me into debt again. Now I need to pay around another $1000 just get it drive-able again. There is nobody to tell this too. Nobody is willing to help me. I'm going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business. I'm fucked. I got fucked. I'm absolutely alone. If you have read this far, I want you to know I'm not asking for money here. Please don't offer. I'm not here for monetary gain. I don't know what I'm here for. I'm sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now. I wish I could just hug someone right now. anybody. I wish I could feel some level of comfort when all I want to do is to lay down and cry. And as I write what I determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation, tears are slowly rolling down my eyes. I don't think I can press submit, but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me. I don't feel like there is anybody I could tell all of this too, which is why I'm writing this right now. I don't want anybody to try and help, I don't know if I can press submit now. It makes me feel like a burden. I don't want to be a burden. I'm just going to do it. Maybe somebody out there can shed some light for me. ",1

Persistent chest pain,"I don't think I've ever been this stressed before.

We reopened at work yesterday and it was insanity, I was angry to the point of shaking over the slightest thing. I woke up this morning with a pain in my chest and neck.

This year..,"How many of y'all have had an exceptionally crappy year? Just a series of unfortunate events nonstop ? I've always had anxiety issues and will literally not sleep or eat until a problem is at least subdued if not resolved. Yet I've also been very very adept at avoiding nonsense and misery in general. All up until this year. It started with covid making life a bit difficult. We a share that issue though. A bit later in the year a very close family member attempts suicide and that alone brought so many issues that lasted a few months. After that episode my 8 year old cat, my best little dude ,passed away due to severe anemia, and i spent 3k of my savings trying to save him.. Now i have what potentially could be a blood disorder ,if not possible (maybe future) leukemia. Family members have had that shit.. I've slept maybe 10 hours in the last 3 days. And for the first time in years I'm terrified and also for the first time in a long time i broke down in tears for a few hours earlier wishing my cat was here. I miss the fuck out of him. I live by the moto ""it could always be worse ""but now this time it seems it probably will GET worse. This year seems to get weirder and weirder. I had so many plans set for this year. I wanted to get a house, take my cat out for car rides more, get a better job , get a home gym ,run more , fix my truck up , go out with friends and maybe find a woman to share my time with. All of that snuffed out and it took my cat with it. I'm in my late 20s and I bust my ass of for my health and wellness and now even that is under heavy threat. I'm definitely not the only one with these issues. I probably have it great to some of you. It sure does seem odd that this all happens this year though as if darkness is catching up.

Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy,"It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person. Spooky.","Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy It’s such a toxic downward spiral.

I play video games every waking moment so I can avoid thinking.,"Being alone with my thoughts is so awful. It’s painful and difficult and I have absolutely no control.

I just wake up and do the bare minimum to exist (and often times don’t even achieve that as I dwell in self neglect...) and pour every minute o can into video games until I’m exhausted enough to pass out within minutes of laying down, because if I don’t then I’ll lay in bed for hours making myself (even more) miserable.

This is so awful and so difficult and it feels impossible to do anything about it. I am in hell.",1

I can’t stand my family and their dysfunction,"I have been suffering from the flu-like symptoms for half a decade now. From throat tightening, nasal drips, muscle soreness, cold, and general depression and now that I’m stuck inside the house with my family. I can’t help but feel helpless. My dad blows a fuse for the smallest things, completely negative & judgmental over everyone. That’s why we don’t have family or visitors come over the house. No one likes him for his personality. Ge’s just far better off that’s why people kiss his ass. What I hate the most is that they don’t have a sense of boundaries. Not being able to have “control” and say about my personal items when he gets unreasonable really upsets me. For example he fucking threw my plants away because he saw news about an increase of dengue cases. Can’t I have anything that’s mine? He’s needy and requires special treatment from everyone. It’s such a drain to be around his negativity and his overall personality. He takes food from my plate even there is literally whole untouched piece right in front of him. He took my food that I paid for without permission even though we’re not in speaking terms. It’s not that I’m tight wad and selfish but the fact that he gets to take my stuff and do as he pleases is the problem. What’s worse is that this learned behavior is exactly what my asshole of a brother does as well. I get anxious just being near or around him. Yesterday I hit my head bad and it started to bleed as I hurried and went into a frantic pace trying to leave the kitchen as soon as he opened his mouth and started talking to me about how to live my fucking life. We’re not even in speaking terms. My mom even left the country to get away from this asshole. They’re not divorced or anything but she’s “making a sacrifice for us to get Japanese citizenship” & started investing there. No wonder my mom had the foresight to offer me to leave the country and this horrible family.","I can’t stand my family and their dysfunction I have been suffering from the flu-like symptoms for half a decade now.

I'm losing hope,"I'm only 19, so I have a lot ahead of me. Honestly I never thought I'd make it this far so I'm very lost on what to do. Recently my nieces were taken from their mother. The reason being something very bad, but WE (my parents, me and my brother who has autism) have absolutely nothing to do with the reason they were taken away. CPS is doing all they can to keep them from us. My parents, their grandparents, have been through court for a whole year now. CPS is making lies, they're harassing us, and just being plain mean to us with rude remarks. The case worker admitted in court that she has no intention of letting us get the girls back, and that she even had no reason for why. How could someone do this??? The foster mom doesn't even want the girls it seems. The foster brother (adopted) bullies the girls, and they're always at daycare instead of with the foster mom. The foster mom wants to adopt them, and then move a few states away. My parents are giving up on trying to get custody. I practically raised these girls. I love them so much. I'm crying typing this lol. It makes me want to give up. How can people be so mean in this world? How can you take children away from their family and be fine with it? How am I supposed to cope with losing them? Because of them, I wanted to actually live and now they're gone. I don't know what to really do anymore.","I'm losing hope I'm only 19, so I have a lot ahead of me. Honestly I never thought I'd make it this far so I'm very lost on what to do.

I hate that depression can just “sleep” for a while and then come back up full force.,"I was doing well until last week when I started sleeping 12 hours again, not eating then over-eating, feeling exhausted at the idea of a shower, crying, being irritable, all of the textbook signals of depression. I’m pushing my partner away and isolating again. I’ve been suddenly reminded depression never goes away, it just lays dormant until it decides to come back, at least in my case. I get my hopes up that I’ve “figured it out,” and am brutally reminded that I haven’t and never will. I’m just tired & very, very sad. I’m sorry for complaining.

Today on the way to work I thought about how nice it would if someone would crash in to me or non fatally shoot me just so I'd get the day off work,"I struggle everyday with waking up & going to work. There are days where I have a text typed out to my boss and i just sit there and stare at for a minute before i delete it and go back in to drone mode. I don't dislike the people. I used to enjoy the type of work I do. But we're essentially mandated to work. I feel like we're all living in survival mode trying to make bank. We're destroying ourselves. For what? Unless I'm lucky I have to give 40 some odd years of my life to our labor force. Then, I'll be lucky if I get 10 years to enjoy when I'm old, frail and probably riddled with medical issues. A different job won't help, extended time off hasn't helped. Work itself is just slowly draining my life force. 10 years has taken it's toll on me and I can't see myself doing another 10 to 30. I was fired last year & took some time off before finding a new job. My mental health improved. I started to do things again. I enjoyed waking up every morning, I even enjoyed going to bed! I ate healthier. I unintentionally lost some weight. I still had issues but things were so much better. Now that I'm working again, i've stopped taking good care of myself again. I hate waking up every morning. I'm filled with anxiety. I eat foods that make me ill. I'm ignoring family and friends again. Things are going right back to where they were. I hate life. You can't just stop working because you can't just stop paying bills. Every single morning I start my day with back pain because I can't mentally get myself to get a new mattress. I don't clean, except my body and clothes before work. I stop brushing my teeth every day. I feel like a need to power cycle my brain. I'm becoming something I don't want, that I don't like and I feel like I'm not in control. I feel like I'm the verge of a mental breakdown almost every day. The wrong words or tone of voice could set me off. I get angered by something as simple as a phone notification. I have this constant feeling of doom that won't go away. I'm so exhausted. ​ I have an appointment with a new PCP tomorrow that i've been waiting weeks for, I don't have high hopes it'll be of any help but I hope someone can help me because I can't help myself.","Today on the way to work I thought about how nice it would if someone would crash in to me or non fatally shoot me just so I'd get the day off work I struggle everyday with waking up & going to work.

Is Being Passively Suicidal a Real Thing?,"I once heard a friend of mine saying that her psychiatrist described her as ""passively suicidal."" Idk if that's a real thing or not, but it really perfectly describes my outlook on life. I'll never have a wife or family, very small social circle, my parents are getting older. Soon enough nearly all of my ties to this world will be gone. I generally enjoy my day-to-day, but I really don't have much of a purpose and to be completely honest don't really have any interest in finding one. If I live to 70, I live to 70. If I die at 40, I die at 40. Hell, if I die tomorrow I die tomorrow. It would be a nice change from trying to live up to people's expectations.","Is Being Passively Suicidal a Real Thing?

I’m gonna blow a gasket,"I’m a male, 16 years old and a junior in high school. I go to a private college prep school with very, very, very challenging work. It’s only been a week of school and I’m already shaking from stress and I’m on the verge of having a breakdown every day. I yelled at my girlfriend for the first time since we started dating almost 5 months ago in a fit of frustration and I immediately burst into tears. I’m having to sacrifice 2-3 hours a night to homework after 7 hours of school and I can’t stand it. I’m dropping AP U.S history (which I thought I was looking forward to) because of how much work it is. But even without APUSH I’m still swamped with work in all my classes. My grades are already dropping, and I barely have time to do the things that actually bring my any sort of happiness. And I feel so weak because of it. Everyone else is just carrying on like it’s no big deal. They know it’s a lot, and they push forward. They take the challenge head on and make it through. They actually contribute to classes unlike me who just sits there silently freaking out and taking notes to save my life. And I’m not even in as many hard classes, nor do I do as many extracurricular activities as some of, if not most of my peers. Some people even poked fun at me when I said I was thinking about dropping AP U.S History. I feel like such a Goddamn quitter and an idiot. But this is just too much for me. I came home every day last week super frustrated and stressed. It’s only been one week. I don’t know if so can deal with 9 months of this without having a huge mental breakdown. I’m so close to blowing a gasket. I hope I’m in the right place to let all this anxiety and frustration out.","I’m gonna blow a gasket I’m a male, 16 years old and a junior in high school.

Is this a bad coping mechanism?,"To be short, my stress stems from other people being stressed. I myself personally have no real issues but this pandemic has made life hard for people I care about and thus causes my stress. The biggest one is a friend of mine who because of the pandemic and her health issues/weak immune system she has been unable to consistently keep a job this year. I help her as best I can; driving her to work/interviews (she has no car), lending her money which I know wont be repaid anytime soon(through no fault of hers) and has depleted my savings account. She also has depression and because of all of this has been having more and more low days. Her roommate also has depression and recently it culminated in him having a breakdown on a bad day and pulling out his gun wanting to end it all. Thankfully we called his best friend and sister and they convinced him to go to a doctor and get help but I know this just compounds my friends anxiety about being a burden on him because she herself has been unable to pay rent the past few months. (Note, he has a very good paying job and doesnt necessarily need her rent, he mostly wanted a roommate for the company but its still a source of great guilt and shame for her.) She just found out today that her seasonal job decided not to keep her on and she has to hunt for another job again and it makes me worried about her even though she seems level headed about it right now and I dont feel like she is a huge risk (right now but I know I still need to keep an eye on her and check in.) The coping mechanism(?) Perhaps this was triggered by her roommates breakdown but through part of the day I've just been running the scenario through my mind What if she does kill herself? I run it through my head how I might act, or feel, who I would call, what life might be like for me afterwards and feel the emotions of the imagined scenario wash over me even as I think about it from a practical stand-point. The reason I call this a coping mechanism(?) is because this isnt the first time I've done this. Almost everyone I know/am close to has depression and is on meds, one of these friends I drove to the hospital after HER suicide attempt a few years ago( a different friend, and I was her crutch at the time like I am for this friend). Almost all of my depressed friends I've run through the horrible scenario in my head and had the thoughts of ""what would I do? How would this effect my life physically and emotionally?"" I do my best to be available for my friend while trying to keep my own mental health in check (even though I feel guilty when I say I cant hang out with her/dont have the spoons to drive to her place as she lives 30 minutes away.), and while Im helping her financially I know I cant keep doing it but I try to help her when she needs rides or small things, but other than that theres not much else I can do to help her, its all been horrendous bad luck out of our control. I know this thought process probably isnt normal but could it just be this weird coping mechanism Im doing to try and assert some sort of control of the situation, or am I a complete sociopath for running the scenarios in my head?","Is this a bad coping mechanism?

Stress been building up,"I don't feel stress most of the time but my body has been piling it up. It's reached to the point where I mainly zone out and ignore it. But the moments where I'm in present moment it comes to hit me like a brick. It's not really a healthy way of coping but I always feel like I have to suck it up and press on. I've felt super burnt out from jobs past year and a half. Covid hasn't helped and partner didn't have an income anymore as he wasn't being called in. I managed to find a job I wanted to be in for at least a year - full time. Transitioning to full time felt more taxing. I'm still enjoying it but now I'm stuck just home and work. When I come home I'm completely out of it. 3 weeks ago my partner broke up with me. We lived together, now I have to find a new place as it's too expensive long term for me to keep up. I have to organize handing in me notice+ movers+ cleaners and brace myself for packing. Everything is just building. Taking care of my cat is my top priority as it's another living being that relies on me. I have my first ever appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow over the phone. Needed one for awhile but kept putting it off as thought it was too expensive or I'll be fine once I sort myself out. Think it greatly contributed to a dying relationship and I feel guilty. Thanks for reading my little vent. How do people manage stress? I'm trying to walk around more often but weather doesn't hold up often. Trying out journaling but I figure it isn't going to last after a week or so.","Stress been building up I don't feel stress most of the time but my body has been piling it up.

Job stress,"I've worked at a tier 2 automotive manufacturing plant for almost 11 years. Over the years I've had more and more piled on my plate. It got to where I'm having anxiety attacks regularly at work and at home. After staying at a high level of stress for so long, I feel like I can't think straight anymore. My memory is terrible now, I can't stay focused, I feel frozen in panic most of the time. I literally feel mentally damaged. I've felt like I have nothing left for my child or husband when I get home because I'm mentally drained. Last week I decided I can't live like this anymore and I resigned! I'm tired of spending my life feeling dead inside! I did agree to work from home part time for a few weeks to train a replacement. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next but I feel like I'm heading in the right direction.","Job stress I've worked at a tier 2 automotive manufacturing plant for almost 11 years.

How to deal with work stress,"I have hit my breaking point, which I have been getting to for a long time. The work I am in now is tedious and requires me to make constant decisions. And more has been piled on since new management has taken over. I did leave this position a couple years ago for a different position within the company however, this dismantled due to covid concerns and I was so scared to be jobless, I went back to my old position. Now a year later, I feel stress to the maxed, I'm making mistakes I normally wouldn't and get headaches all the time. I have applied to 2 other positions within the company that are more in line with what I want to do. The pay is good and I've been at this company for 5 years which is why I've stayed so long. I am on vacation right now and have literally cried for days about this. I feel scared I've made too many mistakes from my stress and I don't know what to do. I will be speaking with my Dr and a counselor as I feel its reached that point but any advice on how I can handle my current job before I get a new one would be so helpful.

Feel like I'm at breaking point sometimes,"My whole life is a mess. I am abused by my narcissist parents (who I am also full-time carer for, which makes it all worse). No, I can't leave or get other carers in please just accept that you don't know the whole situation, thank you. My sister (married, 2 kids) never even offers to go grocery shopping (she drives, I don't) for them and when I say to my parents they should ask for her help, they don't want to 'bother' her. Yet they fawn over how amazing and hard working she is. I get called lazy cos I 'quit my job to scrounge government money, using their disability as an excuse'. They don't refer to me as their daughter, they call me their carer. They treat me like a maid, like staff. Yet when my sister does help, it's with things my parents have refused to let me do. So then they come round on Sunday, do the thing, and I feel like it makes me look so lazy. Then when I make a point 'you said no when I offered to do that', I feel petty. Some bg on my sister - Never got beaten by mom, I did - Never left me alone with her kids - I got to change one diaper when they were babies - Refused to teach me how to drive - Never calls me or invites me to her house - Gives me the general impression she doesn't want me around My mental health has never been great but lately... I am just crumbling into a state of nonexistence. - I have no desire to shower, brush my hair, even change my clothes. - Because of my mental health, I forget all birthdays and events and never have the money to give them unless I go without food to do so. They say it's fine but I get that *look*. You know the look. That 'oh, here's the family fuck up again' kind of look. - I drink daily (not loads, just every evening I drink low alcohol wine), this brings on the binge eating which makes me feel sick, sometimes I am sick - Due to care work I can't take days off, or breaks. Due to lack of support this is even less possible. I'm sorry this is all over the place. I just don't know what to do. I hate my life. I hate myself, and who I have become. This isn't me. I used to be so happy, life of the party, I used to dress up and feel pretty. I look so fat, stressed and tired I loathe catching my reflection these days. I just hate myself. Been to doctor's TWICE (different ones) they don't give a shit. One laughed at me the other said I don't ahve time for your life story, and just shoved tablets under my nose, offering me free counselling which doesn't work.

43 and completely lost,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct. I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression. I'm so disappointed in the person I've become. No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges. I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations. I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking. I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave. I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years. My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder. I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy. Nothing seems to help. I'm unbelievably critical of myself. Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit. I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written. I'm even more amazed by the responses. How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice? I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained. I can't imagine giving advice to someone. There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress. I'm a mess right now. I have lost hope of getting better. I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day. I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents. Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me. The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since. I have some solid friends that I've known since high school. They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. I can't seem to learn anything these days. I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things. I can't imagine surviving another 40 years. I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer. I've no real skills to rely on. I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day. I no longer think I'm capable of having a family. Too overwhelming. I would be an awful spouse and father. I don't plan to go back to work. I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life. By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them. My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run. I've read so much on coping with this disease. But so little spurs me to action. Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions. The weed stopped working for me though. Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse. Thanks for reading all this. I love you.","43 and completely lost I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct. I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.

I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents. Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me. The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since. I have some solid friends that I've known since high school. They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. I can't seem to learn anything these days. I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things. I can't imagine surviving another 40 years. I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer. I've no real skills to rely on. I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day. I no longer think I'm capable of having a family. Too overwhelming. I would be an awful spouse and father. I don't plan to go back to work. I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life. By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them. My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run. I've read so much on coping with this disease. But so little spurs me to action. Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions. The weed stopped working for me though. Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse. Thanks for reading all this. I love you.",1
Doesn't it fucking suck how you can be laughing and enjoying something but at the same time remain unbelievably sad the whole time.,I feel like nothing makes me happy; even when I'm laughing and enjoying something like a movie or some shit I still just feel incredibly upset and depressed. Sometimes I actually feel worse.,Doesn't it fucking suck how you can be laughing and enjoying something but at the same time remain unbelievably sad the whole time.
